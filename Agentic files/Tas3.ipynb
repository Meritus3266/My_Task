A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax is [expression for item in iterable] where the expression is evaluated for each item. You can also add conditions with [expression for item in iterable if condition].\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)] creates [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81].\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested list comprehensions are possible: matrix = [[i for i in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]. You can also use multiple for clauses: pairs = [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)].\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are more efficient than using loops and append() for most cases. They are readable and Pythonic. Performance testing shows list comprehensions are typically 20-40% faster than equivalent for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use list comprehensions to flatten nested structures: flattened = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]. This is equivalent to nested loops but in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced usage includes ternary operators: [x if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in range(10)]. This creates conditional values in the list based on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other comprehension types include dictionary comprehensions: {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}, and set comprehensions: {x**2 for x in range(5)}. These follow similar patterns but produce different data structures.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The most basic decorator is created by defining a wrapper function inside another function. The decorator uses the @decorator_name syntax. When you apply @decorator_name to a function, Python automatically passes the function to the decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something before the function\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call say_hello(), it will print \"Something before\", then \"Hello!\", then \"Something after\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators with arguments need an additional layer: a decorator that returns a decorator. This allows passing parameters to customize behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include:\n",
    "- Logging: Track when functions are called\n",
    "- Authentication: Check permissions before executing\n",
    "- Caching: Store results to avoid recomputation\n",
    "- Timing: Measure function execution time\n",
    "- Validation: Check inputs before processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's functools.wraps decorator is important for maintaining metadata of the original function. Without it, the wrapper loses the original function's __name__ and __doc__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class decorators work similarly to function decorators. The @dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module is a popular example that automatically generates special methods like __init__ and __repr__.\n",

    "        \"title\": \"Understanding Python Generators\",\n",
    "        \"content\": \"\"\"Generators are a way to create iterators using a simple function. A generator function yields values one at a time, pausing execution and resuming from where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key keyword is 'yield'. When a function contains yield, calling it doesn't execute the code immediately but returns a generator object. Each time you call next() on the generator, it executes until the next yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def count_up(n):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",

    "    print(number)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are memory efficient because they generate values on-the-fly rather than storing all values in memory at once. This makes them ideal for processing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses: (x**2 for x in range(10)). This creates a generator instead of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator protocol involves three methods:\n",
    "- next(): Gets the next value from the generator\n",
    "- send(): Send a value back to the generator\n",
    "- throw(): Throw an exception into the generator\n",
    "- close(): Close the generator\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions can be combined with context managers using the contextlib.contextmanager decorator to create context managers from generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common patterns include:\n",
    "- Reading large files line by line without loading into memory\n",
    "- Infinite sequences: def infinite_counter(start=0): n = start; while True: yield n; n += 1\n",
    "- Pipeline processing: combining multiple generators\n",

    "- threading.Lock(): Thread synchronization\n",
    "- decimal.localcontext(): Decimal precision settings\n",
    "- tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(): Temporary file management\n",

    "1. Exceptions in __enter__: Resource is not acquired\n",
    "2. Exceptions in with block: __exit__ still runs\n",
    "3. Exceptions in __exit__: Handled or propagated based on return value\n",
    "\n",
    "The __exit__ method signature is: __exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback). Return True to suppress exceptions, False to propagate.\n",

      " Agent: Generators are a special type of iterable in Python that allow you to iterate through a sequence of values without storing the entire sequence in memory at once. They are defined using functions and the `yield` statement, which allows the function to return a value and pause its execution, maintaining its state for the next call.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features of Generators:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators yield items one at a time and only when required, which makes them more memory efficient than lists, especially for large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are produced on-the-fly, which means they are computed only when requested. This can lead to performance improvements in certain scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **State Retention**: When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object. This object can be iterated over, and it remembers its state between iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Creating a Generator\n",
      "\n",
      "You can create a generator using a function with the `yield` statement. Here's a simple example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def count_up_to(max):\n",
      "    count = 1\n",
      "    while count <= max:\n",
      "        yield count\n",
      "        count += 1\n",
      "\n",
      "# Using the generator\n",
      "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
      "for number in counter:\n",
      "    print(number)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output:\n",
      "```\n",
      "1\n",
      "2\n",
      "3\n",
      "4\n",
      "5\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `count_up_to` function is a generator that yields numbers from 1 to a specified maximum. Each time `yield` is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the next time the generator is called, it resumes from where it left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators are a powerful feature in Python that can help you write more efficient and cleaner code, especially when dealing with large datasets or streams of data. They are widely used in scenarios like reading large files, processing data streams, and implementing coroutines.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any more questions about generators or related topics, feel free to ask!\n",
      "\n",
