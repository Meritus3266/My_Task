This flexibility enables developers to tackle a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Python's extensive standard library and a rich ecosystem of third-party packages, such as NumPy for numerical computations and Django for web development, broaden its applicability even further.\n",
