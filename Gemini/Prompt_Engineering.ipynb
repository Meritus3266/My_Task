      "3.  **Learn from Data:** This is how ML works. Imagine teaching a child to recognize a cat. You don't give them a list of rules (\"it has whiskers, four legs, pointy ears...\"). Instead, you show them many pictures of cats and point out, \"That's a cat,\" until they learn to identify new cats on their own. \"Data\" is all those pictures and examples you show the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Make Predictions:** Once the computer has learned from the data, it can then make educated guesses or decisions about new, unseen information. If it learned from cat pictures, it could then \"predict\" whether a new animal picture is a cat or not.\n"
