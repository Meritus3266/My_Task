Percy who \nlives in Victoria, British Columbia was interested in purchasing the cottage owned by \nTanko. On September 10, Percy wrote a letter to Tanko offering to purchase of the \ncottage and other appurtenances for $300,000. Tanko received the letter on September 15 \nand sent Percy an electronic mail and fax at the same time offering to sell the cottage to \nhim for $350,000. Percy did not respond to the email or fax immediately, but on a \nbusiness trip to Calgary. On September 22, he spoke about the cottage to Tanko on an \neffort to determine if Tanko might be waiting to reduce the price. Tanko replied that the \nprice was firm at $350,000. When Percy returned to Victoria, British Columbia, he sent a \nletter to Tanko accepting the offer to sell the cottage at $350000. The letter was posted at \n11:40 a.m. on September but through a delay in the mail, it was not delivered to Tanko in \nCalgary until 4:20 p.m. on September 28th. \nIn the meantime when Tanko had not heard from Percy by September 26, he offers to sell \nthe cottage to Johnson who had expressed an interest in purchasing the cottage for some \ntime before Johnson accepted the offer and the two parties executed a written purchase \nagreement in Johnson’s office on the morning of September 27. Identify the negotiations \nin this case and address all legal issues dealing with decided and relevant cases. \n(Question 1, 2012) \n \n2.​ Consensus ad idem is germane to any contract which will be enforceable. by this, “one \nthing is common to all these transactions and that is the existence of an agreement which \nwill enable the enforcement of rights and obligations between the parties. See (Shonubi v \nOnafeko). Discuss. (Question 2, 2012); (Question 2, 2018); (Question 2, 2014) \n \n3.​ Tade, one of the successful candidates at the last post utme examination of the University \nof Ibadan has approached you on some issues of Law bordering particularly on forms of \ncontract. He stated that he heard from a friend that apart from all forms of contract under \nseal; all other contracts are simple ones. Kindly educate Tade. (Question 3, 2012) \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n4.​ Kunle has been offered admission to study law in the university has submitted his \nacceptance to the admission office. Slyjet told Kunle that by the street application of the \nlaw of contract, his offer of admission by the university and acceptance of the admission \namounted to a contract. He stated further that since Kunle is 17 years old, his admission \nis invalid because Kunle has not attained the age of majority under the Nigerian law of \ncontract. Hajara who has also been offered admission said she’s 18 years and by virtue of \nthe Nigerian constitution, a contract with the university is valid because voting age in \nNigeria is 18 years. Ejiro on the other hand said that by virtue of the Child’s Right \nConvention, an 18 year old can enter into a contract. Samson said that their argument \nwere mere academic exercises that the main issue should be whether the students are \nunder obligation to pay the balance of the laptops given to them at low costs, at the point \nof acceptance of their respective admission since they are minors. Take a position on each \nof the above statement with reasons. (Question 5, 2012) \n \n5.​ Hamisu cannot read or write in English but can communicate effectively in Hausa \nlanguage.

What are The likely questions you would ask Hamisu in order to \ndraught a statement of defense. (Question 6, 2012) \n \n6.​ An invitation to treat is not an offer that can be accepted to lead to an agreement or \ncontract and therefore cannot form the basis of any course of action. Per Uwaifo JSC in \n(Neka B.B.B Manufacturing Co  v African continental Bank LTD). Discuss (Question 1, \n2019); (Question 4, 2016) \n \n7.​ The defendant wrote to the plaintiff on1st August 2004 offering to sell 900 tons of iron at \n50,000 naira Par ton.  On the same day the plaintiff wrote to the defendant offering to buy \n900 tons of iron at 50,000 naira per ton. The letter crossed in the post.  The plaintiffs \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nargued that there was a contract between them.  They court dismissed the plaintiffs case \nand the court held thus: \n \n“When the contract is made between parties, there is a promise by one in consideration of \nthe promise made by the other, there are two assenting minds, the parties agreeing in \nopinion and they wonder having promised in consideration of the promise made by the \nother, there is an exchange of promise but I do not think exchanging offers made on the \nother side in ignorance of the promise or offer made on the other side neither of them can \nbe construed as an acceptance of the offer”. \nJustify this position in light of established principles of the law of contract.

Shortly after \nAkintunde Left the store,  Akinola who left the bar upon consumption of eight bottles of \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nStar beer staggered into the shop to buy a similar phone under the same arrangement as \nAkintunde's.  While Akinola was about leaving the store,  he went back to AlhajiAdamu \nthat he should also sell on credit,  an umbrella branded with apple logo,  to prevent him \nfrom being drenched by the heavy downpour.  what are the likely legal issues that might \narise from the above facts.

(Question 6, \n2016). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nQUESTION 1 \nTanko lived in Calgary, Alberta, and owned a cottage on Vancouver island. Percy who \nlives in Victoria, British Columbia was interested in purchasing the cottage owned by \nTanko. On September 10, Percy wrote a letter to Tanko offering to purchase of the \ncottage and other appurtenances for $300,000. Tanko received the letter on September 15 \nand sent Percy an electronic mail and fax at the same time offering to sell the cottage to \nhim for $350,000. Percy did not respond to the email or fax immediately, but on a \nbusiness trip to Calgary. On September 22, he spoke about the cottage to Tanko on an \neffort to determine if Tanko might be waiting to reduce the price. Tanko replied that the \nprice was firm at $350,000. When Percy returned to Victoria, British Columbia, he sent a \nletter to Tanko accepting the offer to sell the cottage at $350000. The letter was posted at \n11:40 a.m. on September but through a delay in the mail, it was not delivered to Tanko in \nCalgary until 4:20 p.m. on September 28th. \nIn the meantime when Tanko had not heard from Percy by September 26, he offers to sell \nthe cottage to Johnson who had expressed an interest in purchasing the cottage for some \ntime before Johnson accepted the offer and the two parties executed a written purchase \nagreement in Johnson’s office on the morning of September 27. Identify the negotiations \nin this case and address all legal issues dealing with decided and relevant cases. \n(Question 1, 2012) \n \nANSWER \nTHE USE OF FIRAC \n \nFACTS \na.​ Tanko own a cottage in Vancouver Island  \nb.​ Percy interested in buying the cottage \nc.​ Percy wrote a letter to Tanko on September 10, offering to purchase his cottage and other \nappurtenances for $300,000. \nd.​ Tanko received the letter on September 15 and sent Percy an electronic mail and fax at \nthe same time offering to sell the cottage to him for $350,000 \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \ne.​ Percy did not respond to the email or fax  \nf.​ On September 22, Percy spoke to Tanko if he was ready to reduce the price but Tanko \nClaimed that the price was firm at $350,000 \ng.​ Percy on getting home accepted Percy’s offer to sell at $350,000 \nh.​ The letter was posted at 11:40 a.m. on September but through a delay in the mail, it was \nnot delivered to Tanko in Calgary until 4:20 p.m. on September 28th. \ni.​ Tanko, having not heard from Percy on September 26, offers to sell the cottage to \nJohnson. \nj.​ Tanko and Johnson executed a written purchase agreement on September 27. \n \n \nISSUES \na.​ Whether or not there was a cross offer between Tanko and Percy \nb.​ Whether or not, the offer between Tanko and Percy amounts to a counter offer \nc.​ Whether or not, the letter posted on September 22, by 10:44am constitutes a valid \naccepted as at that moment \nd.​ Whether or not, the contract a entered into between Tanko and Johnson is Valid. \n \n \nRULE \n-​\nIt is The law that when offers are identical in terms and such offer flows from one \nparty to the other,  such offer shall amount to a cross offer. This position was held \nin the case of (Tinns v Holfman).Furthermore, \n-​\nFor an agreement to constitute a contract,  there must be a reciprocal act of \nacceptance.  However,  in situations where there is a variation to the terms of the \ninitial offer,  then such acceptance shall constitute an invalid form of acceptance \notherwise known as Counter Offer. See (Hyde v Wrench) and (Maj Gen. George \nInneh v Agro Ferado LTD). \n-​\nSubsequently the moment of acceptance is very germane in every contractual \nagreement.  The general rule of the moment of acceptance was clearly expressed \nby Lord Denning in the case of (Entores v Miles Far East co.) Where it was held \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nthat the moment of acceptance is the moment at which the offeror is brought to \nthe knowledge of the receival of such offer. However, this Rule takes its separate \nposition when acceptance is done by posts. \n-​\n Rule of acceptance by post was clearly expressed by Lord Ellensborough in the \n1818 case of (Adams v Lindsell) where the court held that the moment of \nacceptance is the time of posting. \n-​\nLastly,  the position of law is that when an agreement is expressly written and \nagreed upon,  such agreement is valid except where it is vitiated by mistake,  \nmisrepresentation,  fraud or duress. (Courtier v Hastie). \n \nAPPLICATION \n1.​ The act of Percy writing a letter to Tanko Offering to buy his cottage and the \nreciprocal act of Tanko offering to sell his cottage to Percy constitute an act of \ncross offer as held in the case of (Tinns v Holfman). \n2.​ Furthermore there was a contractual variationin the price negotiated for the \ncottage. Percy proposed to buy at $300,000 While Tanko proposed to sell at \n$350,000. This actual constituted a counter offer as there was no acceptance to the \nterms of the initial offer (Hyde v Wrench) \n3.​ Percy having posted the acceptance letter, the position of law is that a valid \nacceptance was made at 11:40; the moment when the letter was posted. This \nposition follows after the rules outline by Lord Ellensborough in the case of \n(Adams v Lindsell). \n4.​ Tanko's agreement with Johnson who was void of a common mistake known as \nmistake as to subject matter otherwise known as Res Extincta (couturier v Hastie). \nThe subject matter of the contract which was the cottage was absent as at the time \nan agreement was reached between Tanko and Johnson. Hence, this makes the \nagreement between Tanko and Johnson void of mistake. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n-​\nFrom your political scenario given above, and relying on the set of existing rules \nwith due application to the existing issues, there was a valid contract between \nTanko and Percy to sell a cottage at the rate of $350,000 and the contract between \nTanko and Johnson is therefore invalid. \n \n \n \n \nQUESTION 2 \nConsensus ad idem is germane to any contract which will be enforceable by this, “one thing \nis common to all these transactions and that is the existence of an agreement which will \nenable the enforcement of rights and obligations between the parties. See (Shonubi v \nOnafeko). Discuss. (Question 2, 2012); (Question 2, 2018); (Question 2, 2014) \n \nAPPROACH \nConsensus ad idem, also known as \"meeting of minds,\" is a fundamental principle in contract \nlaw that requires both parties involved in a contract to share a mutual understanding of the \nessential terms and conditions of the agreement. In order for a contract to be enforceable, there \nmust be a clear agreement between the parties regarding their rights and obligations. This \nprinciple has been over time described as the hallmark of all contractual agreements. This flows \nfrom the fact that the court because write contracts, instead the parties to an agreement besides \nthe terms of the agreement. \nIn the case of (Bilante Nig. LTD v National Deposit Insurance Company), the court noted that \n“contracts between parties must be the meeting of minds otherwise known as consensus ad \nidem” similarly, in (Nigerian Port authorities LTD. V Lotus Plastic & Anor)the supreme Court \nheld that “parties are free to negotiate the terms of their relationship”. \nConsensus ad idem ensures that the parties have a common understanding of the key elements of \nthe contract, such as the subject matter, price, quantity, quality, and delivery terms. It establishes \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nthe basis for enforcing the rights and obligations derived from the agreement. When parties enter \ninto a contract, they must express their intention to be bound by the terms and conditions \noutlined in the agreement. This intention, along with a common understanding of the contract's \nessential elements, is crucial for the enforceability of the contract. This is the rationale behind the \nPacta Sunt Servanda rule. \nFor example, if Mr. A and Mr. B agrees to enter into a contract where Mr. B  agrees to sell his car \nfor $10,000, it is important that he and Mr. A are on the same page regarding the car's make, \nmodel, condition, and any additional terms such as the date of delivery or payment terms. If Mr.    \nA believes they are discussing a new car, while Mr B believes they are talking about a used car, \nthere is no consensus ad idem, as they do not share a common understanding of the subject   \nmatter. In such a case, the contract would likely be unenforceable. \nThe above position was the rationale why various forms of offer acceptance are regarded as \ninvalid. In (Tinns v Holfman), The defendant, Mr Hoffman wrote to the complainant, Mr. Tinn \nwith an offer to sell him 800 tons of iron for the price of 69s per ton. He requested a reply to this \noffer by post. On the same day, without knowing of this offer, Mr Tin also wrote to Mr Hoffman.   \nHe offered to buy the iron on similar terms. It was held in this case that there was no contract \nbetween Mr. Tinn and Mr. Hoffman for the iron. The cross offers were made simultaneously and \nwithout knowledge of one another; this was not a contract that would bind the parties for the \niron. This position was reached due to the lack of meeting of minds. A similar position was \nfurther held in the case of (Hyde v Wrench). \nConsensus ad idem is fundamental because it establishes the basis for enforcing contractual \nrights and obligations. Without a common understanding and agreement between the parties, it \nwould be difficult to determine the parties' intentions and expectations, making it hard to enforce \nthe contract. \nIn summary, consensus ad idem is paramount to the enforceability of a contract. It ensures that \nboth parties share a mutual understanding of the essential terms and conditions of the agreement, \nallowing for the enforcement of rights and obligations between them. \n \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nQUESTION 3 \nTade, one of the successful candidates at the last post utme examination of the University of \nIbadan has approached you on some issues of Law bordering particularly on forms of contract. \nHe stated that he heard from a friend that apart from all forms of contract under seal; all other \ncontracts are simple ones. Kindly educate Tade. (Question 3, 2012) \n \nANSWER. \nContracts have been classified based on various modes across different jurisdictions. However \nthe most celebrated classification of contract is formal and simple contracts. Formal contracts \nwere the first set of contracts to be adopted into the common law following the actions of the \nAssumpsit in the 16th century. All forms of contract other than formal contracts are known as \nsimple contracts. For better understanding, brief exegesis will be done and formal contract and \nsimple contract. \n \nFormal Contracts or Contract under Seal: \nA contract under seal, also known as a deed, is a formal written agreement that is typically \nsigned, sealed, and delivered by the parties involved. Historically, contracts under seal held a \nhigher level of enforceability and were subject to different legal rules compared to simple \ncontracts. In the case of (Adejuagbe Light ind LTD v Chinanwe), the Supreme Court held that: A \ndeed is binding on its maker even though it’s part has not been exchanged,  so long it has been \nsigned sealed and delivered. However, Subsequent to 1867, the house of the Lord held in (Xenox \nv Wickham) that a deed is binding on its maker even though it’s parts has not been exchanged so \nlong it has been signed, sealed and delivered. \nFurthermore, the significance of contracts under seal has diminished over time and has been \nlargely replaced by simple contracts in modern legal systems. One of the striking features of a \ncontract under seal is that it does not require consideration to be legally binding. Consideration, \nwhich is an essential element of a simple contract, refers to the exchange of something of value \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nby both parties involved or better still could be defined in terms of forbearance following the \ndefinition of Lush J in (Currie v Misa). In contrast, a contract under seal is considered legally \nbinding even if one party does not provide consideration. This rule typically applies to deeds \nrelating to property, wills, and certain types of financial transactions. \nAdditionally, contracts under seal generally have a longer statute of limitations compared to \nsimple contracts. This means that parties have a longer period to bring a legal action to enforce \nthe terms of a contract under seal. However, this extended time limit is often subject to specific \nstatutory provisions and may vary depending on the jurisdiction. \n \nSIMPLE CONTRACTS \nAs aforesaid, a simple contract is any contract which does not fall under a formal contractor \ncontract under the seal. Hence, the major distinguishing feature between a simple contract and \nyou formal contracts is this deal. However it is worthy to note that an essential ingredient of \nevery simple contract is consideration.  Thus,  only a person who has furnished consideration can \nenforce a simple contract.  In view of this, the Supreme Court expressed in the case of (Odutola v \nPaper Sack LTD) that a party alleging an Oral agreement has the duty to prove such agreement to \nthe halt. Thus, simple contracts have its spine rested upon the element of Consideration. \nThe Importance of consideration to simple contracts was further expressed by Skynner B in \n(Rann v Hughes)That all laws are by the laws of England  Distinguished into agreement by \nspecialty(contract under seal) Under agreement by Parol (simple contracts); Nor is there any \nthird class as contract in writing. If they are merely written and not specialties, they are parolAnd \nconsideration must be proved. \nIt is worth noting that the distinction between contracts under seal and simple contracts has been \nreduced or even eliminated in many legal systems. In some jurisdictions, the use of contracts \nunder seal has been largely abandoned, and the laws that govern simple contracts have been \nextended to cover all types of agreements. This trend reflects a general movement towards \nsimplifying contract law and promoting consistency and fairness in contractual relationships. \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nDecided cases have contributed to the decline in the significance of contracts under seal. Courts \nhave often recognized that the formality associated with contracts under seal may not be \nnecessary in many modern commercial transactions. As a result, they have been more inclined to \ntreat contracts without a seal as simple contracts, subject to the same legal principles and \nrequirements. \nIn conclusion, contracts under seal have historically held a higher level of enforceability and \nhave been subject to different legal rules compared to simple contracts. However, the \nsignificance of contracts under seal has diminished over time, with the trend moving towards the \nrecognition of simple contracts as the predominant form of agreement in modern legal systems. \nDecided cases have played a significant role in contributing to this shift, reflecting a more \nsimplified and consistent approach to contract law. \n \n \n \n \n \nQUESTION 4 \n Kunle has been offered admission to study law in the university has submitted his acceptance to \nthe admission office. Slyjet told Kunle that by the street application of the law of contract, his \noffer of admission by the university and acceptance of the admission amounted to a contract. He \nstated further that since Kunle is 17 years old, his admission is invalid because Kunle has not \nattained the age of majority under the Nigerian law of contract. Hajara who has also been offered \nadmission said she’s 18 years and by virtue of the Nigerian constitution, a contract with the \nuniversity is valid because voting age in Nigeria is 18 years. Ejiro on the other hand said that by \nvirtue of the Child's Right Convention, an 18 year old can enter into a contract. Samson said that \ntheir argument were mere academic exercises that the main issue should be whether the students \nare under obligation to pay the balance of the laptops given to them at low costs, at the point of \nacceptance of their respective admission since they are minors. Take a position on each of the \nabove statement with reasons. (Question 5, 2012) \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n \nANSWER \nThe usage of FIRAC PRINCIPLE \nFACTS \na.​ Kunle submitted his acceptance letter to the admissions office having been admitted to \nstudy law. \nb.​ Slyjet told Kunle That is action of acceptance and offer by the university constituted the \ncontract \nc.​ Slyjet noted that, Kunle's Admission is invalid because he is still a minor \nd.​ Hajara, an 18 year old newly admitted Claimed that her admission is valid because voting \nage is 18 by virtue of the Nigerian constitution \ne.​ Ejiro Claimed that an 18 year old can enter into a valid contract by relying on the Child \nConvention Rights Act. \nf.​ Samson Questioned whether students are under obligation to pay the balance of the \nlaptops given to them at low cost at the point of acceptance of their respective admissions \nsince they are minors. \n \nISSUES \n1.​ Whether or not, Kunle’s Action of submitting an acceptance letter to the admission office \nconstitute A valid contract under the law of contract \n2.​ Whether or not, Kunle’s Admission is valid since he is still a minor \n3.​  Whether or not, Hajara's Admission is valid by virtue of the Nigerian constitution and \nthe voting age of 18 \n4.​  Whether or not, Ejiro can rely on the child’s convention rights Act \n5.​ Whether or not the students are obliged to pay the balance of the laptop given to them at \nlower costs considering that they are still minors \n \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nRULE \nFor an action to constitute a valid Contract, there must be presence of the 5 elements which \nconstitutes a Valid contract and these elements includes Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, \nIntention and capacity. This was well emphasized in the case of (Orient Bank v Bilante Intl). \nThese 5 Elements must be Precise, Unambiguous and Plain. \nTherefore, as aforesaid, a contract must consist of \na.​ An expression of willingness to contract on specific terms (BFIG v Bureau of \nPublic Enterprise),  \nb.​ A reciprocal act as a form of response to such expression(Orient Bank v Bilante \nIntl), \nc.​ There must be some sort of inducement moving from the promisee(Curie v Misa). \nd.​ The parties to the contract must intend to create a legal relationship (Balfour v \nBalfour) and finally \ne.​ Both Parties must have capacity to the contract. \n \n-​\nFor a university admission to be valid, certain requirements must be met. Thus, \none of the requirements which precursors a valid admission is the attainment of \nthe Age of majority. The position of law according to the law of Contract is that \nthe age of majority is 21. This position has its origin from the English Laws. \nHowever, in situation where there is a particular local enactment which relates to \nthe subject matter, such enactment shall prevail over the rule of English law. This \nposition was clothed in the case of (Nze Benard Chigbu v Tominas) where Niki \nTobi expressed that: “ where a local law has been made and it applies to a local \nsituation, courts of law has no jurisdiction to travel all the way to England to \nlook for an English law, for it is the intention of the legislators who had made \nthose laws to apply it in their locality and not an English law which is foreign \nand inapplicable” \n-​\nThe law of Contract has its origin from the Actions of Assumpsit in the 16th \nCentury. Hence, it is largely governed by the English Law. By this fact, the \nprovision of voting age by virtue of the Nigerian constitution specifying Age 18 \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nas the age of Majority for voting is largely immaterial to situations of contracts. \nThe court often relies on the Common Law Age. \n-​\nAlso, with respect to Conventions, the position of law is that, where such \nconvention has been signed and domesticated, such law shall become valid upon \ndomestication. This rule is provided for per Section 14, CFRN1999. \n-​\nWith respect to infants, it is the Law that, any contract entered by an infant is \nvoidable at the instance of such infant (Labinjoh v Abake), except such article is \nan article of necessity, he shall pay a reasonable price thereof (Peter v Flemings). \nThis rule has also been provided for in Section 2(1) of the SGA 1893. \n \nAPPLICATION \n1.​ By virtue of the university of Ibadan giving Kunle admission, an offer has arise. The \naction of Kunle subsequently submitting an acceptance letter at the admissions office \nconstitutes Acceptance. There is an executory consideration to pay school fees flowing \nfrom the promisee (Kunle). The parties are further bound by Legal intentions and finally, \nfor Kunle to have been considered for a provisional admission, he must have satisfied the \nage requirement of the University. \n2.​ Kunle being a boy if 17 years is still a minor within the scope of law of Contract and will \nnot be allowed to enter into a valid contract except a contract of Necessity. However, \nthere must have been a special enactment which must have made Kunle to have been \noffered admission. \n3.​ Hajara’s admission is not a factor to be determined by the Constitution. The Constitution \nonly specifies the political and governmental framework of the country and also provides \nfor the age at which voting is done and not the age of contractual capacity nor the age \nrequirement of the university. \n4.​ The Child Convention Act happens to be an international instrument which only has the \nforce of law and can be relied upon when it has been ratified and domesticated. Hence, as \nan international law, it continues to remain persuasive law within the realms of contract \nAnd Ejiro cannot rely upon it. \n5.​ The payment of an article bought by a minor is a subjective case. The germane question \nis whether the article is a necessary or not. The SGA, Section 2 defines a necessary as \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nanything suitable for the sustenance of life such as food. In this case, we are concerned \nabout laptop which is considered as a luxury. Hence, the position in the case of (Labinjoh \nv Abake) remains the law. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nIn light of the hypothetical scenario given above, and based on the application of the relevant \nrules to the issues which ensued, Kunle’s acceptance constitutes a valid contract. Secondly, \nKunle having satisfied the university's requirements, his admission his valid. \nOn the other hand, Hajara cannot be allowed to rely on the Constitutional provision of 18 years; \nhence, her admission is not valid on that grounds. Ejiro's reliance on the Child Convention Act is \ninvalid due to it being an international instrument which has not been domesticated. Finally, the \nstudents are not bound to pay the balance of the laptop since they were infants and the contract is \nnot a contract of necessity. \n \n \n \n \nQUESTION 5 \nHamisu cannot read or write in English but can communicate effectively in Hausa language. \nHamisu entered into a contract with a bid for the supply of a tanker of load of petrol.

(Question 6, \n2012) \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nANSWER \nFACTS \n1.​ Hamisu cannot read and write in English \n2.​ Hamisu can communicate effectively in Hausa \n3.​ Hamisu entered into a contract of the supply of a tanker of load of petrol \n4.​ Hamisu took 15 cans of Heineken before signing the contract \n \nLIKELY QUESTIONS TO ASK HAMISU BEFORE DRAFTING THE STATEMENT OF \nDEFENCE \n1.​ In what language the contract was reached. \n2.​ Whether or not the terms of the written agreement was read out to him (following the \nprovision is Section 2 of the Illiterate Protection Laws). \n3.​ Whether or not the documents was signed by the Hamisu. \n4.​ Whether or not, the reading of the document and the signature was done before an \nIlliterate Jurat. \n5.​ Whether or not, Hamisu fully understand the terms of the agreement before signing it. \n6.​ Whether or not, Hamisu was conscious as at the time the document was signed by him. \n \nThe above Questions are necessary Questions to be asked in order to prepare a statement \nof defense for Hamisu. \n \n \nQUESTION 6 \nAn invitation to treat is not an offer that can be accepted to lead to an agreement or contract and \ntherefore cannot form the basis of any course of action. Per Uwaifo JSC in (NekaB.B.B \nManufacturing Co  v African continental Bank LTD). Discuss (Question 1, 2019); (Question 4, \n2016) \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n \n \nANSWER \nFor an agreement to crystallize into a contract  there must be the presence of the valid elements \nof a contract which ranges from offer to acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal \nrelations and capacity.  The first requirement in all contractual agreements is the existence of an \noffer which was defined in the case of (B.F.I.G v Bureau of Public Enterprise). However, it is \nnoteworthy that, not all forms of offers are valid as there could be invalid forms of offer. Such \ninvalid forms of Offer are called INVITATION TO TREAT. \nAn Invitation to treat as the word implies means invitation to negotiate, invitation to make an \noffer, or invitation to chaffer.  It can also be described as an offer to make an original offer or an \noffer to negotiate. It is often preliminary to the real offer. The term Invitation to treat was \nexpressly defined in the case of (Gibson v Man City council). Furthermore, Invitation to treat can \ncome in various forms and these forms include Auction, Display of goods or services, \nAdvertisements, Invitation to tender. \n \nAUCTION \nThe term Auction is one of the invalid forms of offer. Within the parlance of commercial law,  \nthe term Auction may be defined as an act of selling articles or commodities to the highest \nbidder. The general rule of law is that an auction does not constitute an offer but an invitation to \ntreat notwithstanding, an offer only arises when the auctioneer's hammer falls. This rule was \njudicially blessed in (Payne v Cave). \nFurthermore, in a case of auction, the auctioneer is bound to sell the lot to the highest bidder as \nemphasized in (Adebaje v Conde), except the auction is with reserve. This principle was upheld \nin the case of (Harris v Nickerson). \nWith respect to referential bid, the court is of the opinion that, a referential bid is an invalid form \nof auction as the House of the Lords rightly noted in (Hervala Investment Nig LTD v Royal Trust \nCompany of Canada) that, “if every bidder makes a referential bid, the whole auction will be \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \naborted but, if one makes and the other does not, the one who has failed to make will be \ncheated”. \n \nDISPLAY OF GOODS AND SERVICES \nAccording to the words of CJ Parker in the case of (Fishers v Bell), “The display of an articulate \nshop with a price tag on it is only an invitation to treat and not an offer”. The position of law is \nthat the display of goods or services cannot constitute a valid form of offer. This principle was \nfurther reiterated in the case of (Pharmaticular Company of Great Britain v Boot cash chemist) \nand (Lasky v Economy Grocery stores). \n \nADVERTISEMENT \nThe general position of law is that, advertisements constitute an invitation to treat.  However, it \ndepends on the nature of such advertisements.  To start with, advertisement is an act of creating \nawareness about a particular subject matter. Hence, advertisement can come in two forms which \nare (a) Unilateral advertisements and (b) Bilateral advertisements. Where advertisements are \nunilateral and such advertisements are plain, unambiguous, unequivocal and not subjected to \nfurther negotiations, such advertisement shall constitute an Offer. See (Carlill v Carbolic \nSmokeball Co.) But where such advertisement is subjected to further negotiations, such \nadvertisement shall constitute an Invitation to treat. \nOn the other hand, for a Bilateral Advertisements, It is the law that such advertisement ab initio \nconstitutes and invitation to treat. This position was blessed in the case of (Patridge v \nCrittenden). The rationale behind this is that they could lead to further bargaining. Hence, they \ncannot be termed an offer. This rule received further judicial pronouncement in the case of \n(Grainger & Sons v Grough). \n \nINVITATION TO TENDER \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nThe vacation to tender will be defined as add invitation to negotiate and not an offer. This \nposition was held at common law in the case of (Spencer v Herding).An invitation should be \npresented in a clear and orderly manner and should be addressed to a small number of interested \nparties. An invitation to tender is otherwise known as CALL FOR BIDS \n \n \n \nQUESTION 7 \nThe defendant wrote to the plaintiff on 1st August 2004 offering to sell 900 tons of iron at 50,000 \nnaira Par ton.  On the same day the plaintiff wrote to the defendant offering to buy 900 tons of \niron at 50,000 naira per ton.  The letter crossed in the post.  The plaintiffs argued that there was a \ncontract between them.  They court dismissed the plaintiff’s case and the court held thus:  \n“When the contract is made between parties, there is a promise by one in consideration of the \npromise made by the other,  there are two assenting minds,  the parties agreeing in opinion and \nthey wonder having promised in consideration of the promise made by the other, there is an \nexchange of promise but I do not think exchanging offers made on the other side in ignorance of \nthe promise or offer made on the other side  neither of them can be construed as an acceptance of \nthe offer”.  justify this position in light of established principles of the law of contract. (Question \n2, 2019). \n \nANSWER \nThe question above centers on cross offer. Cross offer is an invalid form of acceptance and this \noccurs whenan offer is made to another in ignorance that the offeree has made an initial offerof \nthe same fact element or condition to the offeror. It occurs when two offers identical in terms are \nsent to each other by post or by any other means. \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nIn (Tinns v Holfman&Co.)The defendant, Mr Hoffman wrote to the complainant, Mr \nTinn with an offer to sell him 800 tons of iron for the price of 69s per ton. He requested a \nreply to this offer by post. On the same day, without knowing of this offer, Mr. Tin also \nwrote to Mr Hoffman. He offered to buy the iron on similar terms. This case concerned \nthe validity of these two cross offers. \nThe issue in this case was whether there was a valid contract between Mr Tinn and Mr \nHoffman for the sale of the iron. There was also the issue if acceptance had to be by post \nfor it to be valid, as this was specified in the offer. \nIt was held in this case that there was no contract between Mr Tinn and Mr Hoffman for \nthe iron. The cross offers were made simultaneously and without knowledge of one \nanother; this was not a contract that would bind the parties for the iron. There is a \ndifference between a cross offer and a counter offer. In order to form a valid contract, \nthere must be communication that consists of an offer and acceptance. There was no \nacceptance by post, as had been stated in the offer. The court also said that while post had \nbeen indicated in the offer, another equally fast method would have been successful, such \nas a telegram or verbal message. \n \nSimilarly also, in the question given above, the actions of the 2 parties (the plaintiff and \nthe defendant) constitutes a cross offer and such offer is deemed to be invalid within the \npurview of Law. Hence, there is no acceptance, and a valid Contract cannot be formed. \n \n \n \nQUESTION 8 \nAll contracts are agreement but not all agreements are contracts. Discuss (Question 3, 2019), \n(Question 3, 2016) \n \nANSWER \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nIn legal terms, an agreement refers to a mutual understanding between two or more parties about \ntheir rights and obligations. On the other hand, a contract is a legally binding agreement that is \nenforceable by law. Similarly, Niki Tobi JCA (as he then was) in (Orient Bank v Bilante Intl.) \nDefined a contract as an agreement between two or more parties creating reciprocal legal \nobligations to do or not to do particular things. Thus, while all contracts are agreements, not all \nagreements are contracts due to the failure to meet the necessary requirements which constitutes \na valid contract. \n \nThis Position follows the rule that not all agreements can be enforced in courts. This Can be as a \nresult of absence of one of the a sensual element of a contract. There are two prominent factors \nwhich could make an agreement unenforceable in the courts. (1) Absence of one of the elements \nwhich constitutes A valid contract.   (2) The absence of intention to create legal relations. \n \nFor a contract to be valid,  they must be an expression of willingness to contract on specific \nterms  (offer) and to such offer, there must be a reciprocal assent to such expression \n(acceptance).In line with this agreement,  both parties must furnish consideration which must \nessentially move from the promisee and such promises must be bound by an intention to create \nlegal relations by both parties.  Finally both parties must have the capacity to enter into such \ncontractual agreement within the purview of law. \n \n However, not all contracts are enforceable, as some contracts lacks the intention to create legal \nrelations. Such contracts include social and domestic contracts. This position has received \njudicial activism in a plethora of cases. In (Balfour v Balfour), A husband promised to pay his \nwife a £30 per month allowance.  The wife sued her husband to enforce the promise. The court \nheld that agreements between husband and wife to provide monies are generally not contracts \nbecause the “parties do not intend that they should be attended by legal consequences.” Hence, \nthere was no Contract. \nThis principle of law was further reiterated in(Spellman v Spellman)and pushed to an harsh \nextreme end in (Jones v Padavatton) where the court held that social and domestic engagements \nare based on good faith and there is no intention to create legal relations. However, this rule is \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nnot without exception. The exception was visited in the case of (Mc Gregor v Mc Gregor) and \nreiterated in (Merritt v Merritt) Where the court expressed that where there’s a strained \nrelationship between the couples,  any agreement reached between both couples shall be deemed \nto have intended legal consequences.  \nIn conclusion, the statement that all contracts are agreements but not all agreements are contracts \nholds true. While all contracts are based on agreements, not all agreements meet the necessary \nrequirements to be considered legally binding contracts. The presence of essential elements such \nas offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations determines whether an \nagreement can be classified as a contract. \n \n \n \nQUESTION 9 \nPerson who is not a party to a contract has no right or liability under it and therefore the contract \ncannot be enforced against him. Enumerate the principle of law in the statement and discussed \nfully the exceptions. (Question 1, 2018); (Question 4, 2019) \n \nANSWER \nThe doctrine of privity of contract was succinctly stated in the locals classical case of (Dunlop \nPneumatic tyres v Selfridge Co).This doctrine states that only a person who is a party to a \ncontract cancel upon it.  Lord Eldon said in the above case that \n My Lord, in the laws of England, certain principles are fundamental. One is that only a \nperson who is a party to a contract can sue upon it. \nThis principle received further judicial blessings in the case of (B.B Agupo & Sons v \nOrthopedic Hospital Board) where Kekere Ekun JSC further expressed the rule of privity by \nstating that, only parties to a contract can maintain an action on it. Even if the contract benefits a \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nthird party, the third party shall not be allowed to sue or be sued because he has furnished no \nconsideration in support of the contract. \n The above principle is however not without exceptions.  Exceptions to the rule of privity of \ncontract includes Agency, Contract of insurance, Contracts running with land, Charter Parties, \nSpecial application of Trust and the concept of Equity. \nThe general principle of privity was applied in the case of (Price v Easton) Where is Easton \npromised to set off X debt to Price if and only if Easton works for him.  The court held that Price \ncannot sue for the failure of Easton on the basis that Price was not a party to the contract as the \ncontract was only between X and Easton. This rule was further reiterated in the case of (Tweddle \nv Atkinson). The Court expressed in the case of (Tweddle v Atkinson) that “Generally, a \ncontract cannot be enforced by a person who is not a party, even if the contract is made for his \nbenefit and purports to give him right to sue upon it” and in support of this, the court as well \nnoted in (Negbenebor v Negbenebor) that where the doctrine of privity fails, the parties is seen \nas a party to the contract. \nThe rationale behind the Doctrine of privacy was given in the case of (Ladimeji v Federal Min. \nof Works & Housing) where the principle was once more reiterated that “The law is sacrosanct \nthat a contract binds only the party to it and cannot be enforced by or against a Person who is not \na party even if the contract was made for his benefit”. the exceptions to the doctrine of privity of \ncontract will be briefly expressed below. \nEXCEPTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF PRIVITY OF CONTRACT. \n1.​ COVENANT RUNNING WITH THE LAND \nIt is now a settled law that in special cases, the doctrine of privity shall serve as exception \nto contracts affecting lands when there is a restrictive measure. This rule was \nconsolidated in the case of (Tulk v Moxhay). In the aforementioned case, the court held \nthat “a restrictive covenant voluntarily accepted by a purchaser of a land as part of the \ncontract of sale within certain circumstances bind persons who subsequently acquired the \nland”. This standing rule has been the order of the day since antiquity. Notwithstanding, \nthere have been further development on this rule, where it was held that the mere notice \nof a restrictive covenant will not be sufficient to activate this rule but instead the original \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nseller of the land must have retained some other parts of the land in the neighborhood for \nthe benefit or protection of which the restrictive covenant was taken.  This rule is said to \nhave evolved from the doctrine of equity and was examined in the case of (Fromby v \nBarker). In the aforementioned case, it failed the test of the rule outlined in (Tulk v \nMoxhay) on the grounds that there was no retention of a part of the land sold out. Thus, it \nwas seen as a personal covenant and not a covenant running with land. The \ncharacteristics of a covenant running with land were well illustrated in the case of (Smith \nv River Douglas Catchment Board) where Somervell J. adopted the judgment of \nFarewell J. in (Rogers v Hosegood) in outlining the features of a covenant running with \nland as follows: \n(a)​It must be made with a covenanted who has an interest in the land to which they \nrefer and \n(b)​They must concern and touch the land. In the Learned lord Justices view, the \nconditions were satisfied in this case \n \n2.​ FAMILY LAND \nThe sale of family land under customary law is another exception to the doctrine of \nprivity of Contract. Various courts decisions have shown that, members of a family are \nentitled to being an action to set aside conveyance which has been made without their \nconsent. See (Lewis v Bankole). Karibi Whyte JSC also further expressed in the case of \n(Adejumo v Ayantegbe) that at customary law, “the ownership of family land is vested \nin the past, present and future member of the family”. Thus, a family land belongs to \nall members of the family and it does not matter, if he is a party to the contract or not. \nThe doctrine of privity will not prevail. \n \n3.​ CONTRACTS FOR THR HIRE OF CHATTEL \nThe question under this exception of law is that, can a third party who has once furnished \nconsideration to an agreement under a charter enforce such Contract if the chattel is \nmortgaged or sold to another person and such person plans to act inconsistency with the \nagreement reached between the charterer and the third party? \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nThis question of law has been succinctly addressed by Knight Bruce LJ in the case of \n(De Mattos v Gibson) where he noted that “when a man purchases or acquires \nproperties from another with knowledge of a previous contract lawfully and for \nvaluable consideration made by him, with a third party to use and enjoy the \nproperty for a particular purpose in a specified manner, the acquirer shall not to the \nmaterial damage of the third person, in opposition to the contract act inconsistency \nwith it, use the property in a manner which is not allowable to the giver or seller”. \nThis rule was further powerfully boosted in the Privy Council decision of (Lord \nStrathcona Steamship Co v Dominion Coal co) \n \n4.​ INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS \nAs held In the case of (Lumley v Wenger). It shall amount to a legal wrong at common \nlaw, torts for a person knowingly to interfere with the contractual rights of others. The \nrule of wrongful interfere is equally applicable to chattel and services. This rule was also \napplied in (British Motor Trade Association v Salvador). Thus, a person shall not be \nallowed to interfere in other people’s contractual obligations. \n \n5.​ RESTRICTION UPON PRICE \nThe case of (Dunlop Pneumatic Tyres v Selfridge Co) has not but furnished some \nelements in relations to the restriction upon price. The principle of law on this subject \nmatter is that, if A (a manufacturer) sells to B (a dealer) on a condition that all the retailer \nbuying from B must undertake not to sell below a particular price. I’d such retailer \nviolates this undertaking, A cannot sue the retailer because there is no privity of Contract \nbetween them. Conditions do not run with goods as they run with land. Thus, to cases \nrelated to the restrictions upon price to goods, the rule of privity shall be exempted.  See \n(Tardy & Co v Serious & Co). \n \n6.​ INSURANCE \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nInsurance Contracts have evolved to serve as an exception to the doctrine of privity and \nan example of this have been well provided in Section 11, Married Women Act provides \nthat: \nWhere a man insures his life for the benefit of his wife and children and vice versa \n(Woman); the woman shall be allowed to due despite not being a party to the contract and \nthe principles of privity will not avail. \n \n \n \nQUESTION 10 \nWrite short notes on the following \na.​  Invitation to Treat. (Question 3, 2018) \nb.​ Offer. (Question 3, 2018) \nc.​ Acceptance. (Question 3, 2018) \nd.​ Consideration. (Question 3, 2018) \ne.​ Intention to create legal relations. (Question 3, 2018) \n \nInvitation to Treat: \nAn invitation to treat is an invitation for negotiations or expressions of interest in entering into a \ncontract. It is not a legally binding offer, but rather a preliminary step towards potentially \nforming a contract. Invitation to Treat can otherwise be described as offer to receive other offers \nor offer to chaffer. The rule of invitation to Treat was expressed in the case of (Gibson v Man \nCity Council). Examples include advertisements (Patridge v Crittenden), Auction (Payne v \nCave), and displays of goods for sale (Pharmaticular company of Great Britain v Boot Cash \nChemist) , Tender (Spencer v Herding). \n \nOffer: \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nAn offer is a definite proposal made by one party to another, indicating a willingness to enter into \na contract. The Supreme Court defined an offer in the case of (Storer v Manchester City) as (a) \nan expression of willingness to contract on specific terms (b) with an intention that it is to \nbe binding upon the party to whom it is addressed. An offer must contain specific terms and \nconditions that, if accepted, would result in a binding agreement. An offer can be made orally, in \nwriting, or even through conduct. However, an offer must be plain, unequivocal and \nunambiguous. The general rule of offer is that, an offer must be communicated. This rule was \nexpressed in the case of (Felthouse v Bindley). \n \nAcceptance: \nAcceptance is the unconditional agreement to the terms of an offer made by the other party. In \n(Orient Bank v Bilante Intl) Nikki Tobi defined Acceptance in the following words. “An \nacceptance to an offer is a reciprocal act or action  from the offered to the offeror in which \nhe indicates his agreement  To the terms the offer as conveyed to him by the offeror. Putting \nit in another language, An acceptance is a compliance In the part of the offeree to the terms \nof the offer. It is the element of acceptance down that scores the bilateral nature of a \ncontract”. However, one of the guiding principles of Acceptance is that, It must be \ncommunicated to the offeror. See (Liard v Taylor). Acceptance creates a binding contractual \nagreement between the parties involved. \n \nConsideration: \nConsideration is a very vital element of every contractual agreements and without consideration, \nthere cannot be a valid contract except such contracts is under seal. In lieu of this, The court held \nin the case of (Gray Shot v Minister of Agriculture) that “except an agreement is under seal, \nit cannot be enforced by a party who has not furnished some consideration in support of \nit”. The term consideration have been most comprehensively defined by the court in the words of \nLUSH J. in (Curie v Misa) thus: A valuable consideration in the eyes of law must consist, \neither in some right, interest, profit or benefit according to one party or some forbearance, \ndetriment, loss of responsibility, given suffered or undertaken by the other…… In the \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nsimplest sense consideration can be defined as some sort of inducement given to enter into a \ncontract of which makes such contractual agreement enforceable by the courts. There was an \nattempt by Lord Mansfield to equate moral obligations to consideration when he became the CJ \nin 1756. However, this rule was demolished in 1840 in the classical case of (Eastwood v \nKenyon). This dead doctrine propounded by Lord Mansfield was later reawakened by Aguda J. \nin the case of (Barclays Bank Co v Sulaiman) where the test of moral obligation was again \nquestioned. This question of law became finally settled by the court in the Nigerian case of \n(Faloughi v Faloughi) where the court held that natural love or affection was not a true or real \nconsideration before it was not capable of estimation in terms of value. Furthermore, it is a \ngeneral rule of contracts that consideration must move from the promisee. This follows the \ndoctrine of QUID PRO QUO. However for a consideration to be deemed valuable in the eyes of \nlaw, such consideration needs not to be adequate but sufficient. I.e It must confess some sort of \nbenefit to the promisor Or some sort of detriment to the promisee. What is meant by the above \nstatement  is that,  in the absence of fraud, duress or misrepresentation, The court is only \nconcerned with the concept of consideration and not its value or worth. \n \nIntention to Create Legal Relations: \nThis refers to the understanding that both parties intend to be legally bound by their agreement. \nThis is the major element which differentiates Contracts from other form of agreement. In order \nfor a contract to be enforceable, there must be an intention to create legal relations. Unlike other \nforms of contract, not all contracts are enforceable in court due to the absence of Intention. \nSocial agreements, such as casual conversations between friends, may not have the intention to \ncreate legal relations unlike business and commercial agreements. The concept of Intention has \nreceived a plethora judicial activism. In (Balfour v Balfour), A husband promised to pay his \nwife a £30 per month allowance.  The wife sued her husband to enforce the promise. The court \nheld that agreements between husband and wife to provide monies are generally not contracts \nbecause the “parties do not intend that they should be attended by legal consequences.” \nHence, there was no Contract. This principle of law was further reiterated in (Spellman v \nSpellman) and pushed to an harsh extreme end in (Jones v Padavatton) where the court held \nthat social and domestic engagements are based on good faith and there is no intention to create \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nlegal relations. However, this rule is not without exception. The exception was visited in the case \nof (Mc Gregor v Mc Gregor) and reiterated in (Merritt v Merritt)  Where the court expressed \nthat where there’s a strained relationship between the couples,  any agreement reached between \nboth couples shall be deemed to have intended legal consequences. \n \n \nQUESTION 12 \nOnce consideration is some sort of value in the eyes of the law the court has no jurisdiction to \ndetermine whether it is adequate or inadequate. (Gaji v Faye). Examine the above statement in \nview of consideration as an element of a valid contract. (Question 3, 2014) \n \nANSWER \nOvertime, consideration has formed the hallmark of all contractual agreements and as a general \nrule; a party who has furnished no consideration cannot bring an action upon it. Consideration is \na very vital element of every contractual agreement and without consideration, there cannot be a \nvalid contract except such contracts is under seal. In lieu of this, the court held in the case of \n(Gray Shot v Minister of Agriculture) that “except an agreement is under seal, it cannot be \nenforced by a party who has not furnished some consideration in support of it”. \nThe term consideration have been most comprehensively defined by the court in the words of \nLUSH J. in(Curie v Misa) thus:A valuable consideration in the eyes of law must consist, either in \nsome right, interest, profit or benefit according to one party or some forebearance, detriment, loss \nof responsibility, given suffered or undertaken by the other……In the simplest sense \nconsideration can be defined as some sort of inducement given to enter into a contract of which \nmakes such contractual agreement enforceable by the courts. \nThere was an attempt by Lord Mansfieldto equate moral obligations to consideration when he \nbecame the CJ in 1756. However, this rule was demolished in 1840 in the classical case of \n(Eastwood v Kenyon). This dead doctrine propounded by Lord Mansfield was later reawakened \nby Aguda J. in the case of (Barclays Bank Co v Sulaiman) where the test of moral obligation was \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nagain questioned. This question of law became finally settled by the court in the Nigerian case of \n(Faloughi v Faloughi) where the court held that natural love or affection was not a true or real \nconsideration before it was not capable of estimation in terms of value. \nFurthermore, it is a general rule of contracts that consideration must move from the promisee. \nThis follows the doctrine of QUID PRO QUO. However for a consideration to be deemed \nvaluable in the eyes of law, such consideration needs not to be adequate but sufficient. I.e It must \nconfess some sort of benefit to the promisor some sort of detriment to the promisee. What is \nmeant by the above statement is that, in the absence of fraud, duress or misrepresentation, The \ncourt is only concerned with the concept of consideration and not its value or worth. \nIn view of the above, Lord Somervell expressed in the case of (Chappel v Nestle) thus: “A \ncontracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses,  A peppercorn does not cease \nto be a good consideration if it is established that  The promise does not like the pepper and \nthrows away the corn”. Also, the court emphasized in (Thomas v Thomas) that “The court does \nnot declare a contract invalid simply because  One party got a better bargain than the other”. \nFinally, the principle of Adequacy of consideration was finally laid to rest by KAGLO JCA in \n(Faloughi v Faloughi) where he clearly opined that, “ and once the consideration is some sort of \nvalue in the eyes of law, the court has no jurisdiction to determine whether it is adequate or \ninadequate”. Summarily, the court is not concerned with the value of Consideration, provide that \nsuch consideration is reached in the process of bargain between both parties in the absence of \nfraud, duress or misrepresentation. \nFurthermore, for consideration to be valid, it must be of economic value in the eyes of law, and \nmust be free from vagueness, ambiguity and unascertainability. In (White v Bluett), the court \nrejected the consideration of the late husband on the basis that it was just mere wishes and had no \nphysical or economical value. Also, consideration could be either Executed or Executory. An \nExecuted Consideration is a consideration which has been performed in support of a promise \nwhile an Executory consideration is one where the promise for value is not immediate but based \non a future or later date. \nHowever, it is noteworthy to state, that not all forms of consideration are valid. Invalid forms of \nconsideration could include (a) Total failure of consideration by means of gratuitous Promise (b) \nTotal failure of consideration in situations where the plaintiff totally fails to furnish consideration \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n(c) where consideration is furnished by the 3rd party and (d) where there is a claim of an excess \nof benefit provided in an agreement. \nIt is a general rule of contract that consideration must move from both parties in the contract. \nNotwithstanding, in situations where consideration is furnished by a party to another, who fails \nto furnish consideration in return, in support of a promise, such promise shall be regarded as a \nnon legally binding promise otherwise known as a Gratuitous promise. This rule received \njudicial pronouncement in the case of (L.A Cardozo v Executors of the Estate of Late J.A \nDoherty). \nSecondly, where there is a Total failure of consideration by the plaintiff, or where either party has \ntaken no obligation on the side of the contract, such Contract will be deemed to be devoid of \nconsideration following the words of Cotton LJ in (Miles v New Zealand Alford Estate Co.) \nwhere it was held that “there must be something moving from the other party towards the person \ngiving the promise”. Thus, every promise has to be backed up by consideration, otherwise, there \ncan be no liability arising from it in situation of breach. \nThirdly, where consideration is furnished by the third party and not the plaintiff.  The plaintiff \ncannot bring an action upon such promise.  This follows after the doctrine of privity of contract \nwhich states that the person was furnished no consideration cannot bring an action upon it. \n(Gbadamosi v Mbadiwe). \nLastly, where there is a claim of an excess of benefit provided in an agreement, a promise for \nsuch excess shall not be enforceable in the court for there is no consideration in support of it. \nThis rule was exemplified in the case of (Eguare v Shell BPD of Nig.). \nIn conclusion, for a contract to be valid and enforceable in the court of law, one of the most \nimportant element which has to be present is Consideration and failure to furnish such \nconsideration will often lead to the unenforceability of such contract except such contract is \nunder seal. \n \n \n \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nQUESTION 13 \nIn the case (BFIG v BPE), it was carefully stated that, the element of acceptance is crucial in \ndetermining the bilateral nature of a contract. The term acceptance was defined In (Orient Bank v \nBilante Intl) by Nikki Tobi in the following words. “ An acceptance to an offer is a reciprocal act \nor action  from the offeree to the offeror in which he indicates his agreement  To the terms the \noffer as conveyed to him by the offeror. Putting it in another language, An acceptance is a \ncompliance In the part of the offeree to the terms of the offer. It is the element of acceptance \ndown that scores the bilateral nature of a contract”. However, there are various forms in which \nAcceptance could follow and a few of these forms are discussed below. \n \nANSWER \n1. Conduct of the Parties: Acceptance can be inferred from the actions or conduct of the parties \ninvolved. This means that if both parties act in a way that suggests an agreement has been \nreached, then acceptance can be deemed to have occurred. In (Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball \nCo), the Court of Appeal held that acceptance by conduct can also apply to unilateral contracts. \nIn this case, the defendant company advertised a reward for anyone who contracted influenza \nafter using their product. The plaintiff purchased and used the smoke ball as advertised, and \nwhen she contracted the flu, she tried to claim the reward. The court held that the advertisement \nwas an offer, and the plaintiff's conduct of purchasing and using the product constituted \nacceptance of that offer. \n2. Words: Acceptance can also be expressed through verbal communication. This can be in the \nform of spoken words during a conversation or through a telephone call where both parties \nexplicitly agree to the terms of the contract.Regarding acceptance by words, the case of (Entores \nLtd v Miles Far East Corporation) provides guidance. In this case, the court held that where \nparties communicate orally rather than in writing, acceptance is generally effective when it is \nreceived by the offeror. The court emphasized that acceptance by words must be communicated \ndirectly to the offeror and must be clearly expressed. \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n3. Documents: Acceptance can be evidenced by the exchange of documents between the parties. \nThis could include signed contracts, proposals, or other written agreements that demonstrate the \nintention to be bound by the terms outlined.Acceptance by document that has passed between the \nparties can be demonstrated by the case of (Household Fire Insurance v Grant). In this case, \nthe defendant was offered a fire insurance policy, and he sent a letter back accepting the offer. \nHowever, before the letter of acceptance arrived, the offeror had withdrawn the offer. The court \nheld that acceptance takes place when the letter of acceptance is posted, as it becomes binding on \nthe parties upon posting. This is known as the postal rule of acceptance. \n4. Post: Acceptance by post, also known as the \"postal rule,\" is a traditional legal principle that \nstates that acceptance occurs when a properly addressed and stamped acceptance letter is posted. \nThis mode of acceptance is effective once the letter is posted, even if it hasn't been received by \nthe other party yet. Acceptance by post is further clarified in the case of (Adams v Lindsell) In \nthis case, the defendants wrote to the claimant offering to sell them some wool and requested a \nresponse by post. However, due to a postal error, the claimant's acceptance was delayed and the \ndefendants sold the wool to someone else. The court held that acceptance is effective upon \nposting, regardless of when it will be received by the offeror. \nOverall, the above details illustrate the various modes of acceptance in contract law, including \nacceptance by conduct, words, documents, and post. It is essential to carefully consider the \ncircumstances and specific facts of each case to determine the validity and timing of acceptance \nin bilateral contracts. \n \n \n \n \nQUESTION 14 \nThe operation of the ruling Pinnel’s case worked hardship and injustice to the defendant who \nwould have believed and relies on the plaintiffs promised to forgo the balance of the debt owed. \nIn view of the aforesaid, discuss the rule in High Tree’s case. (Question 6, 2016). \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \n \nANSWER \nThe rule in Pinnel’s case is majorly applicable under the contractual duty to pay debts. This rule \nwas first developed in 1602 where it was held that the part payment of a debt owed will not \namount to sufficient consideration before the court. However, the court in this case further held \nthat the payment of a fractional part of debt as agreed by the promisee to write off the totality of \nthe debt in addition to a new element will amount to sufficient consideration. The rule outlined in \nPinnel stood as an exception to the Principle guiding the contractual duty to pay debt. \nLitigants have often attempted to use the rule in Pinnel’s case to escape the full rigor of law. This \nattempt was made in the case of (D&C Builders v Rees) where the introduction of a new \nelement was proposed to be used as an escape route. However, this form of reasoning was \ndemolished by Lord Denning in the aforementioned case.  \nDue to the hardship experienced in the Pinnel’s Rule, Equity emerged with a doctrine to mitigate \nits harshness. The classical doctrine which evolved from Equity under consideration to mitigate \nthe Common Law Pinnel’s rule was the rule outlined the case of (High Trees v. Central London \nProperty Trust). Prior to this time, it was first unsuccessfully attempted in the case of (Jordan v \nMoney) where it explained it to be only applicable to statement of Intention and not statement of \nexisting fact. However, this rule received a new position in the 1877 case of (Hughes v \nMetropolitan Ry Co). This emerging rule is commonly known as the doctrine of promissory or \nequitable estoppel. This doctrine serves an exception to the general rule of consideration in \ncontract law. This rule was finally officially blessed in the case of (Central London Property \nTrust v High Trees House). \nIn the case of (Central London Property Trust v High Tree’s House), an action instituted \nimmediately after the World War II. The facts of this case was that, during World War II, the \ndefendant, Central London Property Trust, leased a property from the plaintiffs, High Trees. Due \nto the war, the property suffered from a lack of occupancy, which affected its value and rental \npotential. To address this issue, the plaintiffs agreed to accept a reduced rent amount from the \ndefendant for the duration of the war. \n \nOLOGUNDUDU O.A\n \nAfter the war, the property's value and rental potential increased significantly. At that point, the \nplaintiffs sought to claim the full rental amount from the defendant. In response, the defendant \nasserted that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the full rent due to their previous \nagreement for reduced rent. \nThe court, in its decision, established the doctrine of promissory estoppel. It held that when a \nparty makes a clear and unequivocal promise to another party, intending for the other party to \nrely on that promise, and the other party does rely on it to their detriment, the party making the \npromise is estopped from going back on their promise. \nIn simpler terms, if one party makes a promise and the other party relies on that promise, the first \nparty cannot later renege on the promise if it causes harm or injustice to the other party. In the \ncontext of High Trees' case, the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the full rent owed to them \nbecause they had made a promise to accept a reduced rent, and the defendant had relied on that \npromise to their detriment. \nIt is important to note that promissory estoppel does not create a binding contract, but it prevents \nthe party who made the promise from asserting their strict legal rights to the detriment of the \nother party. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is meant to prevent injustice and unfairness \nwhen parties rely on promises made in good faith. \nIn conclusion, the rule in High Trees' case established the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which \nprevents a party who made a clear and unequivocal promise from going back on that promise if \nthe other party relied on it to their detriment. This rule was established to address and avoid \nhardship and injustice resulting from the operation of the strict rules of consideration in contract \nlaw.", "filename": "fam\\CONTRACT 1 QUESTIONS Original.pdf"}
{"text": "2024/2025 Law of Contract I Assignment \n \nQuestion 1 \n“Parties to an agreement retain the commercial freedom to determine their own terms and \nno other person, not even the court can determine the terms of the contract between them.’’ \nPer Kekere-Ekun JSC in Delmas v Sunny Ositez Int’l Ltd. [2020] All FWLR pt. 1026 at 541 \nparas. B-C. \nExplain the above with the aid of decided cases. \n \nAnswer \nThe statement by Kekere-Ekun JSC in Delmas v Sunny Ositez Int’l Ltd., encapsulates a \nfundamental principle of contract law: freedom of contract and the concept of consensus ad idem \n(meeting of minds). This means that the law primarily facilitates agreements made by individuals \nor entities, rather than imposing terms upon them. \n \nParties' Commercial Freedom to Determine Terms: \n    The principle of freedom of contract allows parties to autonomously negotiate and agree upon \nthe terms and conditions that will govern their relationship. It is crucial that for a contract to be \nenforceable, there must be a \"mutual understanding of the essential terms and conditions of the \nagreement\". This mutual understanding, known as consensus ad idem, is considered the hallmark \nof all contractual agreements. \n \nIn Nigerian Port authorities LTD. V Lotus Plastic & Anor, the Supreme Court explicitly held \nthat \"parties are free to negotiate the terms of their relationship.\" This directly supports the \nidea that parties, and not external entities like the court, are responsible for shaping the content of \ntheir agreements. \nThe emphasis on the parties' own intention is also evident in the definition of a contract provided \nby the Court of Appeal in B.F.I GROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES. It states \nthat a valid contract requires \"mutuality of purpose and intention\" and that \"The two or more \nminds must meet at the same point, event or incident. They must be saying the same thing \nat the same time. They must not be saying different things at different times. Where or \nwhen they say a different thing at different times, they are not id idem and therefore no \nvalid contract is formed.\" This highlights that the terms must originate from and be agreed \nupon by the parties themselves. \n \nCourts Do Not Determine Contractual Terms: \n    The second part of the statement underscores the court's role as an enforcer of agreements, not \na maker of them. Courts uphold what the parties have agreed to, provided it meets the necessary \nlegal requirements for a valid contract, such as offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to \ncreate legal relations, and capacity. \n \nOffer and acceptance reflect party-determined terms. That is, for an agreement to form, an offer \nmust be precise and unequivocal, giving no room for speculation or conjecture as to its real \ncontent. Similarly, acceptance must be absolute and unqualified, plain, unequivocal, \nunconditional and without variance of any sort between it and the offer. If an acceptance \nintroduces new terms, it becomes a counter-offer, which destroys the original offer, rather than \nforming a contract. \nThis principle is demonstrated in Hyde v Wrench, where the plaintiff's offer to buy an estate for \n£950, after an initial offer to sell for £1,000, was deemed a counter-offer that extinguished the \noriginal offer. The court would not force the original £1,000 agreement because the parties' \nminds had not unequivocally met on that specific term. \nThe concept of cross-offers further illustrates this point. In Tinn v Hofman & Co, two parties \nsimultaneously offered to buy/sell iron on similar terms, but neither was aware of the other's \noffer. The court held that there was no contract because, despite identical terms, there was no \ncommunication of an offer and acceptance, and thus no meeting of minds. The court refused to \nconstruct a contract from two separate, unaccepted offers. \n \nAnother example of the court's non-interference with party-determined terms is seen in the \ndoctrine of consideration. While consideration is an essential element of most contracts, its \nadequacy is generally irrelevant to the courts. \nIn Chappel v Nestle, Lord Somervell stated: \"A contracting party can stipulate for what \nconsideration he chooses, A peppercorn does not cease to be a good consideration if it is \nestablished that The promisee does not like the pepper and throws away the corn.\" This \nmeans that as long as something of value (however nominal) is exchanged, the court will not \nquestion whether it was a \"fair\" bargain, as that is for the parties to decide. \nSimilarly, Thomas v Thomas held that a court \"does not declare a contract invalid simply \nbecause one party got a better bargain than the other.\" \nKaglo JCA in Faloughi v Faloughi concisely affirmed that \"once the consideration is some \nsort of value in the eyes of law, the court has no jurisdiction to determine whether it is \nadequate or inadequate.\" These cases collectively show that the courts respect the terms agreed \nupon by the parties, even if they appear imbalanced, as long as there is no fraud, duress, or \nmisrepresentation. \n \nIn conclusion, the statement by Kekere-Ekun JSC underscores the autonomy of contracting \nparties to establish their own terms through a genuine meeting of minds. The role of the court is \nnot to rewrite or dictate the terms of an agreement, but to enforce the terms that the parties \nthemselves have clearly and unequivocally chosen, reflecting the sanctity of contract and the \ncommercial freedom embedded in contract law. \n \n \n \n \nQuestion 2 \n“Put simply, a stranger to a contract cannot gain or be bound by it even if made for his \nbenefits.’’ Per Ogbuinya, JCA in Multichoice Nigeria Ltd. v MCSN Ltd./ GTE [2020] All \nFWLR pt. 1063 p. 733 at 860; paras. A-C. \nIn view of the above assertion, discuss the doctrine of Privity of Contract and the \nexceptions thereto. \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, \"Put simply, a stranger to a contract cannot gain or be bound by it even if made \nfor his benefits\", as articulated by Ogbuinya, JCA, concisely introduces the fundamental \nprinciple of privity of contract. \n \nThe Doctrine of Privity of Contract \nThe doctrine of privity dictates that a person cannot acquire rights or be subject to liabilities \narising under a contract to which they are not a party. This means that a contract between Party A \nand Party B cannot directly affect the legal rights and duties of a third party, C. As Lord Eldon \nstated in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyres v Selfridge Co, a fundamental principle in English law is \nthat \"only a person who is a party to a contract can sue upon it.\" This concept was further \nemphasized in the case of B.B Agupo & Sons v Orthopedic Hospital Board, where Kekere \nEkun JSC stated that \"only parties to a contract can maintain an action on it\". Even if a \ncontract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party is generally not permitted to sue \nor be sued on it because they have not provided consideration in support of the contract. \n \nThe rationale behind this doctrine is that a contract binds only the party to it and cannot be \nenforced by or against a Person who is not a party even if the contract was made for his \nbenefit. Without this principle, it would be difficult to define the scope of contractual obligations \nand who is accountable for them. \n \nExceptions to the Doctrine of Privity of Contract \nDespite its foundational role, the doctrine of privity has been criticized for potentially leading to \nhardship and injustice for third parties who genuinely rely on or are intended to benefit from a \ncontract. Consequently, various exceptions have evolved to mitigate its strict application and \naccommodate the complexities of modern commercial transactions. These exceptions include: \n \nAgency, that is, where an agent negotiates a contract on behalf of a principal, the principal, \nthough not directly involved in the negotiation, can be bound by the contract and acquire rights \nunder it. The relationship is generally regarded as being between the principal and the third party. \n \nContracts of Insurance, that is, insurance contracts commonly serve as an exception. For \ninstance, the Married Women Act (Section 11) provides that if a man insures his life for the \nbenefit of his wife and children (or vice versa), the woman or children are permitted to sue \ndespite not being direct parties to the contract, and the principles of privity will not apply. \n \nCovenants Running with the Land (Restrictive Covenants), that is, in cases involving land, \nrestrictive covenants voluntarily accepted by a purchaser can bind subsequent acquirers of the \nland, provided certain conditions are met. This exception, notably consolidated in Tulk v \nMoxhay, requires that the original seller retains a portion of the land for the benefit or protection \nof which the covenant was taken. \n \nContracts for the Hire of Chattel, that is, a third party, who is not a direct party to an initial \ncharter agreement, may be able to enforce rights if they have furnished consideration and the \nchattel is subsequently mortgaged or sold to another person who then acts inconsistently with the \noriginal agreement. The principle is that an acquirer with knowledge of a prior contract for the \nproperty's use should not act inconsistently with it to the detriment of the third person. \n \nInterference with Contractual Rights, that is, it is considered a legal wrong in common law (a \ntort) for a person to knowingly interfere with the contractual rights of others. This rule applies to \nboth chattels and services and prevents third parties from unlawfully disrupting existing \ncontractual obligations. \n \nRestriction upon Price, that is while conditions generally do not run with goods as they do with \nland, there are situations where restrictions on resale prices might lead to an exception. For \nexample, if a manufacturer (A) sells to a dealer (B) with a condition that retailers buying from B \nmust not sell below a certain price, and a retailer violates this, A typically cannot sue the retailer \ndue to lack of privity. However, this scenario is an example of when the rule of privity would be \nexempted, the court would address the issue despite the absence of direct privity. \n \nFamily Land (under customary law), that is, in the context of customary law, members of a \nfamily are entitled to bring an action to set aside a conveyance of family land if it was made \nwithout their consent, regardless of whether they were a direct party to the transaction. \n \nCollateral Contracts, that is, a collateral contract arises when one party makes a promise to \nanother party, and that other party then enters into a contract with a third party. In such a \nscenario, the second party may be able to enforce the original promise, as if it were a separate, \ncollateral agreement. \n \nValid Assignment of Benefit in Favour of a Third Party, that is, a contract can transfer the benefit \nof that contract to a third party through a formal assignment process. This means the assignee \nreceives the rights under the contract, even though they were not the original assignor. \n \nMultilateral Contracts, that is, when a person or an unincorporated association enters a \ncontractual relationship, other members might be unaware of their identity or have limited \ninvolvement. In such cases, the complexities of multilateral contracts can allow a third party to \nenforce rights that would otherwise be restricted by the privity doctrine. \n \nThese exceptions underscore the courts' approach to ensure fairness and prevent injustice, \nmoving beyond a rigid interpretation of privity in specific circumstances while still upholding \nthe general principle of contractual autonomy. \n \n \nQuestion 3 \nCapacity to enter into a contract is an element of a contract which is capable of rendering \nthe contract void, voidable and or unenforceable. \nExamine the above statement with the aid of decided cases. \n \nAnswer \nCapacity to enter into a contract is a fundamental element that determines the validity and \nenforceability of an agreement. As highlighted in the case of Orient Bank v Bilante Intl, for a \ncontract to be valid, it must comprise five essential elements: offer, acceptance, consideration, \nintention to create legal relations, and capacity. These elements must be precise, unambiguous \nand plain. \n \nThe concept of capacity addresses the legal ability of parties to enter into binding agreements. \nIndividuals are generally presumed to have full contractual capacity unless they belong to \nspecific categories of persons who are afforded special protection due to their circumstances, \nwhich could lead to them being exploited or defrauded in contractual bargains. These protected \ngroups include illiterates, lunatics, minors, and drunkards. The absence or limitation of capacity \nin a contracting party can render a contract void, voidable, or unenforceable depending on the \nspecific circumstances and the category of the incapacitated person. \n \nIlliterates \nIlliteracy, particularly in underdeveloped societies, is a dominant factor that necessitates \nprotective measures in contract law. To prevent exploitation, various mechanisms are in place, \nespecially for written contracts. \n \nNigerian law includes specific provisions for the protection of illiterate contractors. Section 2 of \nthe Illiterates Protection Laws mandates that any person writing a document on behalf of an \nilliterate person must sign their own name and address, indicating that the document correctly \nrepresents the illiterate's instructions. Furthermore, it must be read over and explained to the \nilliterate before their signature or mark is affixed. The primary objective of these laws is to \nprotect illiterates from fraud. Strict compliance by the writer is obligatory. The courts, in cases \nlike S.C.O.A Zaria v. Okon and Ezegwe v. Awriou, have affirmed the necessity of this strict \ncompliance. \n \nNon-compliance with these provisions can lead to various consequences, including a penalty \nfine. More importantly for contract validity: \nContracts are generally not enforceable at the instance of the writer. As stated in UAC v Edems \n& Alaya by Smith J., any benefit derived by the writer from such a contract is unenforceable \nagainst the illiterate. The law is not intended to be a weapon to cheat others, as supported by \nKayode Es JCA in Lawal v. GB Olivant. A contract may, however, be enforced at the instance \nof a third party. \n \nInfants: \nThe law grants special protection to infants due to their perceived lack of maturity and judgment. \nAt common law and under Nigerian law (governed by English law principles), the age of \nmajority for contractual capacity is 21 years. This was settled in cases Labinjoh v. Abake. \nWhile customary law might define majority by puberty, the English rule of 21 prevails for \ncontractual transactions. \n \nAs a general rule, contracts entered into by infants are generally not binding on the infant, but \nthey are binding on the other party. This makes such contracts voidable at the infant's option. An \ninfant can repudiate these contracts during infancy or within a reasonable period after attaining \nmajority. If an infant repudiates, they escape obligations that have not accrued at the time of \nrepudiation as held in Steinberg v. Scala Leeds Ltd. \n \nTwo types of contracts are exceptions and are absolutely binding on infants: \nContracts for Necessaries: These are agreements for goods or services essential for the infant's \nsustenance or suitable to their condition in life. The infant is obliged to pay a reasonable price, \nnot necessarily the contract price. A watch, for instance, was considered a necessary for an \nundergraduate in Peters v. Fleming. However, goods for trading purposes are generally not \nconsidered necessaries as held in Cowiern v. Niel's.  \nBeneficial Contracts of Service: These include contracts for education, profession, or trade that \nare for the infant's overall benefit as held in Clemens v. London, De Francesco v. Barnum. \n \nUnder the Infant Relief Act of 1874 (applicable in Nigeria), certain contracts are absolutely \nvoid: \nLoans: An infant cannot be liable for a loan. \nUnnecessary Goods/Luxuries: Money paid by an infant for unnecessary goods is void and \nrecoverable by the infant. \nFraudulent Misrepresentation of Age: If an infant fraudulently misrepresents their age to \ninduce an adult into a contract, equity may grant relief for the restoration of ill-gotten gains to the \nadult. However, this doctrine of restitution will not compel the infant to refund money or goods \nas it would amount to enforcing a void contract as held in Leslie Ltd v. Shell \n \nLunatics (Mentally Disordered Persons - MDPs) \nPersons categorized as Mentally Disordered Persons (MDPs) also have limited contractual \ncapacity. \nContracts for Necessaries: If an MDP enters into a contract for necessaries, they are generally \nbound to pay a reasonable price for them. This is supported by Section 2 of the SGA 1893. \n \nFor contracts not involving necessaries, an MDP will not be bound if two conditions are \nsatisfied: \nThe MDP acted without knowledge of their mental conditio and the other party was aware of the \nMDP's incapacity at the time of contracting. If these conditions are met, the contract is voidable \nat the MDP's option. \nWhen a contract is made with a MDP, Such contract shall be considered valid in situations where \nthe other party was not aware of the incapacity, or where the MDP later ratifies the contract. \n \nDrunkards \nA person in a state of intoxication also has their contractual capacity limited. \nIf a drunk person enters into a contract while in a state of intoxication and their counterpart is \naware of this, the contract shall be voidable at their option. This principle is supported in cases of \nMathews v. Baxter and Gore v. Gibson. \nA drunk person can approve the contract at their sober period, thereby making it binding. Similar \nto lunatics and infants, if the contract is for a necessary, the drunken person is obliged to pay a \nreasonable sum for it. \n \nIn summary, the principle of capacity is crucial to determining a contract's enforceability. While \nsome agreements may appear valid on the surface, the presence of limited capacity in a party can \nfundamentally alter the contract's legal status, rendering it void, voidable, or unenforceable to \nprotect vulnerable individuals. \n \n \nQuestion 4 \n“The operation of the Pinnel’s case worked hardship and injustice to the defendant who \nwould have believed and relied on the Plaintiff’s promise to forego the balance of the debt \nowed.’’ \nDiscuss the above with the copious reference to equitable intervention. \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, \"The operation of the Pinnel’s case worked hardship and injustice to the \ndefendant who would have believed and relied on the Plaintiffs promised to forgo the balance of \nthe debt owed,\" accurately reflects a significant criticism of this common law rule. This hardship \nled to the development of equitable intervention, primarily through the doctrine of promissory \nestoppel, as exemplified by the High Trees' case. \n \nThe rule in Pinnel's Case (1602), primarily applicable to the contractual duty to pay debts, \nestablished that part payment of a debt will not amount to sufficient consideration to \ndischarge the entire debt. This means that even if a creditor promises to accept a smaller sum in \nfull settlement of a larger debt, they could later sue for the remaining balance, because the \ndebtor's payment of a lesser amount did not provide \"new\" consideration for the promise to \nwaive the rest. \n \nHowever, the rule in Pinnel's Case does allow for an exception: if the payment of a fractional \npart of the debt, as agreed by the promisee, is made in addition to a new element, it will amount \nto sufficient consideration. This new element could be paying at an earlier date, at a different \nlocation, or with a chattel, which would legally discharge the debt. Despite this minor \nconcession, the rigidity of the rule often led to hardship and injustice for a defendant who relied \non the plaintiff's promise to forgo the balance of the debt. Litigants frequently attempted to use \nthe rule in Pinnel's Case to escape the full rigour of the law, sometimes proposing new elements \nthat courts, like Lord Denning in D&C Builders v Rees, found insufficient to bypass the core \nprinciple. \n \nDue to the hardship caused by Pinnel's Rule, Equity emerged with a doctrine to mitigate its \nharshness. This classical doctrine, known as promissory or equitable estoppel, serves as an \nexception to the general rule of consideration in contract law. \n \nThe principle was initially explored in Jordan v Money, where it was unsuccessfully attempted \nto apply to statements of intention rather than existing fact. However, it gained clearer definition \nand force in 1877 with Hughes v Metropolitan Ry Co. The rule was finally and officially \nestablished in the landmark case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House \nLtd (1947). \n \nFacts of High Trees' Case: During World War II, Central London Property Trust \n(plaintiffs/landlords) leased a property to High Trees (defendant/tenants). Due to the war, the \nproperty suffered from a lack of occupancy, affecting its value and rental potential. The plaintiffs \nagreed to accept a reduced rent amount from the defendant for the duration of the war. After the \nwar, the property's value and rental potential significantly increased. The plaintiffs then sought to \nclaim the full rental amount, including arrears for the period of reduced rent. The defendant \nasserted that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the full rent due to their previous \nagreement for reduced rent. \n \nThe court, in its decision, established the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Lord Denning held \nthat when a party makes a clear and unequivocal promise to another party, intending for \nthe other party to rely on that promise, and the other party does rely on it to their \ndetriment, the party making the promise is estopped from going back on their promise. \nIn the context of High Trees' case, the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the full rent owed \nfor the period they had agreed to the reduction because they had made a promise to accept a \nreduced rent, and the defendant had relied on that promise. \n \nIt is important to note that promissory estoppel is meant to prevent injustice and unfairness when \nparties rely on promises made in good faith. Also, it does not create a new contract. Furthermore, \npromissory estoppel does not create a binding contract where one did not exist before; instead, it \nprevents the party who made the promise from asserting their strict legal rights to the detriment \nof the other party. Finally, it acts as a \"shield\" (a defense) rather than a \"sword\" (a cause of \naction). \n \nIn conclusion, the rule in High Trees' case (promissory estoppel) directly addresses and avoids \nthe hardship and injustice that could arise from the strict application of common law rules like \nPinnel's Case. It provides an equitable remedy that ensures fairness when one party acts upon a \npromise made by another, even in the absence of traditional consideration. \n \n \nQuestion 5 \n“All the essential elements of a contract are autonomous and equal in the sense that each of them \nput together must be present in order for a valid and binding contract to come into \nexistence.” A.R.M.C. Ltd. v Elizade Nigeria Ltd. [2020] All FWLR pt. 1058 p.1030, \npp.1063-1064; paras. E-A. \nDiscuss. \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, \"All the essential elements of a contract are autonomous and equal in the sense \nthat each of them put together must be present in order for a valid and binding contract to come \ninto existence,\" highlights a fundamental principle in contract law: the cumulative and \nindispensable nature of its core components. A contract is universally understood as an \nagreement that the law will enforce or recognize as affecting the legal rights and duties of the \nparties involved. For such an agreement to be legally binding and enforceable, it must comprise \nseveral essential elements, none of which can be omitted without jeopardizing the contract's \nvalidity. \n \nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria in B.F.I GROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES \n(2008) emphasized this by defining a contract as an agreement creating reciprocal legal \nobligations where there is \"mutuality of purpose and intention\" and \"the two or more minds \nmust meet at the same point, event or incidents\". This meeting of minds, or consensus ad \nidem, is deemed the \"most crucial and overriding factor or determinant\". The principle that \nall contracts are agreements but not all agreements are contracts further underscores that an \nagreement only ripens into a contract when all necessary legal requirements are met. \n \nThe essential elements of a valid contract are: \n \nOffer: An offer is a definite proposal made by one party (the offeror) to another (the offeree), \nexpressing a willingness to enter into a contract on specific terms. It must be precise and \nunequivocal, leaving no room for speculation. The offeror must have finally declared his \nreadiness to undertake an obligation upon certain conditions, leaving to the offeree the option of \nacceptance or refusal. For instance, an offer can be made to the whole world, as demonstrated in \nCarlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., but a contract only forms with those who perform the \nstipulated conditions. Without a clear and definite offer, there is no basis for an agreement to \nbegin. Preliminary steps in negotiations, known as Invitations to Treat, such as displaying goods \nin a shop window or advertisements, are not offers capable of acceptance but rather invitations to \nothers to make offers. \n \nAcceptance: Acceptance is the unconditional agreement to the exact terms of an offer. It is a \nreciprocal act or action that indicates the offeree's agreement to the terms conveyed by the \nofferor. Acceptance is crucial as it underscores the bilateral nature of a contract. A valid \nacceptance must be communicated to the offeror, meaning there must be an external \nmanifestation of assent, not merely a mental or internal decision. Silence, as held in Felthouse v. \nBindley, generally does not constitute acceptance. \n \nInvalid forms of acceptance highlight the necessity of precise and unqualified assent: \nA Counter Offer (Hyde v. Wrench) rejects the original offer and introduces new terms, requiring \nthe original offeror's acceptance. \nConditional Acceptance, such as an agreement subject to contract, does not create a binding \ncontract until the condition is met. \nCross-Offers occur when two parties make identical offers to each other simultaneously and in \nignorance of the other's offer, as in Tinn v. Hofman & Co.; no contract is formed because there \nis no acceptance, only two offers. \nAcceptance in Ignorance of Offer means a person cannot accept an offer they are unaware of. \n \nConsideration: This is an essential element without which a contract, unless made under seal, is \ngenerally unenforceable. Consideration refers to something of value that moves from the \npromisee, constituting some right, interest, profit or benefit to one party, or some \nforbearance, detriment, loss of responsibility suffered or undertaken by the other, as defined \nby LUSH J. in Currie v. Misa. The law requires consideration to be sufficient but not \nnecessarily adequate, meaning courts are generally not concerned with the comparative value of \nthe exchange, provided there is some economic value. As seen in Chappel v. Nestle, \"A \npeppercorn does not cease to be a good consideration if it is established that The promisee \ndoes not like the pepper and throws away the corn\". However, Past Consideration (something \nalready done) and Moral Obligations (as clarified in Eastwood v. Kenyon and Faloughi v. \nFaloughi) do not constitute valid consideration. \n \nIntention to Create Legal Relations: This element determines whether parties to an agreement \nintended for their promises to be legally binding and enforceable in a court of law. Its absence \nmeans \"there is no contract\". \nIn Domestic and Social Engagements, there is generally a presumption against an intention to \ncreate legal relations. For instance, in Balfour v. Balfour, an agreement between a husband and \nwife for a monthly allowance was not considered a contract because the parties did not intend \nlegal consequences. This presumption can be rebutted, especially where there is a \"strained \nrelationship\" between the parties, as illustrated in Merritt v. Merritt. \nIn Commercial Agreements, there is typically a presumption that parties intend to create legal \nrelations. The burden to prove otherwise is heavy. Promises that are merely \"mere puff\" or \n\"exaggeration\" without serious intent are not actionable. \n \nCapacity: Parties entering into a contract must have the legal capacity to do so. The law protects \ncertain vulnerable groups who may lack full contractual capacity: \nMinors: In Nigeria, largely following English law, the age of majority for contractual capacity is \n21. Contracts entered into by infants are generally voidable at their option, meaning they can \nchoose to repudiate them, unless they are for necessities. For necessities, an infant is obliged to \npay a reasonable price, as per Peters v. Fleming and Section 2(1) of the Sale of Goods Act \n(SGA) 1893. However, contracts for loans or unnecessary goods are absolutely void for minors. \nIlliterate Persons: Individuals who cannot read or write, particularly in the language of the \ncontract, are protected by specific laws like Illiterate Protection Laws in Nigeria. The law \nplaces duties on the writer of such a document to ensure the illiterate person understands the \nterms before signing, to protect them from fraud. \nLunatics: Contracts for necessities with a mentally disordered person are binding, and they must \npay a reasonable price. For other contracts, if the other party was aware of their mental \nincapacity, the contract is voidable; if unaware, it may be considered valid. \nDrunkards: A contract entered into by a drunken person is voidable at their option when sober, \nprovided their counterpart was aware of their intoxication. Similar to lunatics, they are obligated \nto pay a reasonable sum for necessities. \n \nIn conclusion, the efficacy of a contract is dependent on the simultaneous presence and \ninterrelation of all these elements. As the quote rightly implies, each element is \"autonomous and \nequal\" in its criticality; the absence of even one can render an agreement legally impotent, \npreventing it from being recognized and enforced as a valid contract. The entire legal framework \nof contract formation is built upon the premise that these components must collectively exist for \na binding agreement to \"come into existence\". \n \n \nQuestion 6 \n“Consensus ad idem is germane to any contract which will be enforceable by law. Thus, ‘one \nthing’ is common to all these transactions and that is the existence of an agreement which will \nenable the enforcement of rights and obligations between the parties.’’ \nShonubi v Onafeko (2003) 12 NWLR pt. 1334, 254 at p.257. \nExplain the above statement and support your answer with the aid of decided cases. \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, \"Consensus ad idem is germane to any contract which will be enforceable by law. \nThus, ‘one thing’ is common to all these transactions and that is the existence of an agreement \nwhich will enable the enforcement of rights and obligations between the parties,\" as highlighted \nby Shonubi v Onafeko, profoundly encapsulates a core principle of contract law: the necessity \nof a meeting of minds for a legally binding agreement to exist and be enforceable. \n \nConsensus ad idem, literally meaning agreement as to the same thing, signifies that for a \ncontract to be valid, both parties must have a mutual understanding and agreement on the \nessential terms and conditions of the agreement. This shared understanding ensures that their \nintentions and expectations align, forming the bedrock upon which reciprocal legal obligations \ncan arise and be enforced. The absence of consensus ad idem means that the parties are not \"id \nidem,\" and consequently, no valid contract is formed. \n \nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria in B.F.I GROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES \ncomprehensively defined a contract as \"an agreement between two or more parties which \ncreates reciprocal legal obligation or obligations to do or not to do a particular thing\". This \njudgment further emphasized that \"For a valid contract to be formed, there must be \nmutuality of purpose and intention. The two or more minds must meet at the same point, \nevent or incidents. They must be saying the same thing at the same time. They must not be \nsaying different things at different times\". The court deemed that meeting of minds as the \n\"most crucial and overriding factor or determinant in the law of contract\". This principle \nunderpins the idea that while all contracts are agreements, not all agreements are contracts, \nbecause an agreement only becomes a contract when it fulfills all necessary legal requirements, \nwith consensus ad idem being paramount. \n \nThe concept of consensus ad idem is intrinsically linked to the fundamental elements of contract \nformation, particularly offer and acceptance. An offer must be a definite proposal with a clear \nwillingness to be bound, and it must be precise and unequivocal, giving no room for \nspeculation or conjecture. Acceptance must then be an \"absolute and unqualified\" assent to \nthe exact terms of that offer, without any variation. It is the reciprocal act or action of the \nofferee to an offer in which he indicates his agreement to the terms of the offer as conveyed \nto him by the offeror. This precise alignment of offer and acceptance creates the consensus ad \nidem. \n \nSeveral decided cases vividly illustrate the importance of consensus ad idem by demonstrating \nwhen it is present and when its absence renders an agreement unenforceable: \n \nIn Nigerian Port authorities LTD. V Lotus Plastic & Anor, the Supreme Court affirmed that \n\"parties are free to negotiate the terms of their relationship,\" underscoring that when parties \ngenuinely agree on terms through negotiation, a mutual understanding exists. The notion that \nparties determine the terms of their agreement is supported by the fact that the courts do not \nwrite contracts, instead the parties to an agreement besides the terms of the agreement. \n \nIn Tinn v. Hofman & Co., two parties sent identical offers to each other simultaneously, \nunaware of the other's offer. The court held that no contract was formed because there was \"no \nacceptance, only two offers\". This outcome was due to the lack of meeting of minds, as \n\"exchanging offers made on the other side in ignorance of the promise or offer made on the \nother side neither of them can be construed as an acceptance of the offer\". \nThe case of Hyde v. Wrench demonstrates that a counter-offer destroys the original offer, \npreventing consensus ad idem from forming on the initial terms. When the plaintiff responded to \nan offer to sell an estate for £1,000 with a proposal to buy for £950, it was deemed a \ncounter-offer. His subsequent attempt to accept the original £1,000 offer was invalid because the \noriginal offer was no longer open; there was \"no obligation whatsoever between the parties\" \nas their minds had not met on a consistent set of terms. \nAn acceptance made subject to contract or other conditions does not create a binding contract \nuntil the condition is met, as seen in Cohen v. Nessadale and Maja Jnr. V. U.A.C.. Such \nconditional statements indicate that the parties' minds have not yet fully met on all the necessary \nterms to form a final, binding agreement. \nA person cannot accept an offer if they are unaware of its existence as whoever is not aware of \nthe existence of an offer and or its details cannot be said to have accepted the offer. This \nunderscores that for minds to meet, there must be knowledge of the proposition being accepted. \n \nIn essence, consensus ad idem is the mutual understanding and agreement that gives legal life \nto a contract, enabling the enforcement of rights and obligations. Without it, an agreement \nremains a mere arrangement without legal enforceability, as the parties' intentions do not align \nsufficiently to create a binding legal relationship. \n \n \nQuestion 7 \n“It is the element of acceptance that underscores the bilateral nature of contract.’’ \nIn view of the above assertion, discuss the following modes of acceptance: \n (a) by the conduct of the parties \n (b) by their words \n (c) by documents that have passed between them \n (d) by post \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, “It is the element of acceptance that underscores the bilateral nature of contract,” \npowerfully conveys that acceptance is not merely a formality but a critical component that \nestablishes the reciprocal obligations and mutual commitment characteristic of a bilateral \ncontract. \n \nA bilateral contract is formed when two parties exchange promises. Acceptance, in this context, \nsignifies the offeree's agreement to the offeror's terms, thereby creating a mutual understanding \nand binding agreement. Without a valid acceptance, there is no meeting of minds (consensus ad \nidem), which is the most crucial and overriding factor or determinant in the law of contract. \nAs stated in B.F.I GROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (2008), a contract \nrequires \"mutuality of purpose and intention\" where \"The two or more minds must meet at \nthe same point, event or incidents. They must be saying the same thing at the same time\". \n \nNiki Tobi J.C.A. in Orient Bank v. Bilante Intl. defined acceptance as \"a reciprocal act or \naction from the offeree to the offeror in which he indicates his agreement to the terms of the \noffer as conveyed to him by the offeror\". This highlights that acceptance is the compliance of \nthe offeree with the offer's terms, solidifying the agreement and moving it beyond a mere \nproposal. \n \nAcceptance must be a final expression of assent to the terms of the offer. It must be absolute \nand unqualified, plain, unequivocal, unconditional and without variance of any sort. \nCrucially, acceptance must be communicated to the offeror. Mental or internal acceptance is \ninsufficient; there must be an external manifestation of assent. \nThe various modes of acceptance demonstrate how this essential meeting of minds is achieved: \n \nBy Conduct of the Parties \n    Acceptance can be inferred from the actions or conduct of the parties involved, meaning if \ntheir actions suggest an agreement has been reached, acceptance can be deemed to have \noccurred. For an acceptance by conduct to be proper, it must be clear that the offeree performed \nthe act with the intention of accepting the offer. \nThe case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. illustrates acceptance by conduct in a unilateral \ncontract. The defendant company offered a reward to anyone who used their smoke ball and still \ncontracted influenza. The plaintiff's purchase and use of the product as advertised was held to \nconstitute acceptance of the offer. This case also demonstrates that communication of acceptance \ncan sometimes be implicitly waived in unilateral contracts. \nIn Major Oni v. Communication Associates, the plaintiff offered to lease flats to the \ndefendants. When the defendants modified the terms to include air-conditioners, the plaintiff \nimmediately installed them. The court held that the plaintiff's conduct of installing the \nair-conditioners constituted acceptance of the defendant's counter-offer. The court focused on \nwhat a \"reasonable person would infer from the conduct of the parties,\" rather than their \nsubjective intentions. \n \nBy Their Words \n    Acceptance can be expressed through verbal communication. This includes spoken words \nduring a conversation or a telephone call where both parties explicitly agree to the contract's \nterms. \nThe case of Entores Ltd v. Miles Far East Corporation provides guidance on acceptance by \nwords, holding that when parties communicate orally, acceptance is generally effective when it \nis received by the offeror. This emphasizes that acceptance must be communicated directly and \nclearly expressed. \n \nBy Documents That Have Passed Between Them \n    \nAcceptance can be evidenced by the exchange of documents between the parties. This \nincludes signed contracts, proposals, or other written agreements that clearly demonstrate the \nintention to be legally bound by the outlined terms.  \n \nBy Post \n    Acceptance by post, known as the postal rule, is a traditional legal principle stating that \nacceptance occurs when a properly addressed and stamped acceptance letter is posted. This \nmode is effective upon posting, even if the letter has not yet been received by the offeror. \nThe landmark case of Adams v. Lindsell first established the postal rule, holding that acceptance \nis effective upon posting, regardless of when it is received by the offeror. The rationale was to \nprevent an \"ad infinitum\" loop where parties would endlessly wait for confirmation of receipt. \nThis case of Household Fire Insurance Co. v. Grant provided more concrete reasons for the \npostal rule, arguing that the post office acts as a common agent for both parties, and that the \ncontract is complete when the letter is posted, as no other act is needed to bring it into existence. \nIt also noted that the offeror is free to make it a term of the offer that acceptance is only valid \nupon receipt, and that the rule is the most convenient and prevents fraud and delay in commercial \ntransactions. \n \nDespite its general application, the postal rule does not apply in certain situations, such as when: \nThe offer's terms expressly or implicitly indicate that acceptance must reach the offeror. \nApplying the rule would lead to manifest inconvenience and absurdity. \nThe letter of acceptance is wrongly addressed or inadequately stamped. \nThe letter was not properly posted for example, if it was handed to a postman not authorized to \nreceive letters. \n \nIn summary, acceptance, through conduct, words, documents, or post, is the mechanism that \ntransforms an offer into a binding agreement. Each mode, when validly exercised, ensures the \nmeeting of minds necessary for a contract to be legally enforceable and for rights and obligations \nto be created between the parties. \n \n \nQuestion 8 \n“…once the consideration is of some value in the eye of the law, the courts have no \njurisdiction to determine whether it is adequate or inadequate.’’- Gaji v Paye (2003) FWLR pt. \n163 p.1 \n \nAnswer \nThe statement, \"once the consideration is of some value in the eye of the law, the courts have no \njurisdiction to determine whether it is adequate or inadequate\", as quoted from Gaji v Paye \n(2003) FWLR pt. 163 p.1 and also backed by Faloughi v Faloughi, encapsulates a fundamental \nprinciple of contract law regarding consideration. \n \nConsideration is a vital element of every contractual agreement, and generally, without it, a \ncontract cannot be valid, unless it is a contract under seal. Lord Lush J. in Curie v Misa \ncomprehensively defined valuable consideration as consisting of \"either in some right, interest, \nprofit or benefit according to one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss of \nresponsibility, given suffered or undertaken by the other\". In its simplest sense, it is an \ninducement given to enter into a contract that makes the agreement enforceable by the courts. \n \nThe core of the quoted statement lies in the distinction between sufficiency and adequacy of \nconsideration: \nSufficiency of Consideration: For consideration to be deemed valuable in the eyes of the law, it \nneeds to be \"sufficient\", meaning it must confer some sort of benefit to the promisor or some \nsort of detriment to the promisee. This aligns with the doctrine of Quid Pro Quo (something \nfor something). \n \nAdequacy of Consideration: However, the law generally holds that consideration does not need \nto be \"adequate\". This means courts are not concerned with the actual value or worth of the \nconsideration. The principle is that parties are free to negotiate and agree on the terms of their \nbargain, and the court will not interfere to determine if the exchange was fair in a subjective \nsense. \n \nIn Chappel v Nestle, Lord Somervell stated that \"a contracting party can stipulate for what \nconsideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be a good consideration if it is \nestablished that the promisee does not like the pepper and throws away the corn\". This \nvividly illustrates that even a trivial item can constitute valid consideration if it is what the \nparties agreed upon. \nSimilarly, in Thomas v Thomas, the court emphasized that \"the court does not declare a \ncontract invalid simply because one party got a better bargain than the other\". \n \nThe principle that courts have no jurisdiction to determine adequacy as long as there is some sort \nof value was finally laid to rest by KAGLO JCA in Faloughi v Faloughi. This case also \nhighlighted that natural love or affection is not considered a true or real consideration because \nit lacks estimable value. \nIt is important to note that this principle will hold true in the absence of vitiating factors such as \nfraud, duress, or misrepresentation. If such elements are present, the contract may be \nchallenged despite the presence of some value. \n \nThis emphasis on sufficiency over adequacy also distinguishes valid consideration from various \nforms of invalid consideration. For instance, a gratuitous promise (where one party fails to \nfurnish consideration in return for a promise) is generally not legally binding. Similarly, if \nconsideration is furnished by a third party and not the plaintiff, the plaintiff generally cannot \nenforce the promise due to the doctrine of privity of contract. These situations demonstrate that \nwhile courts do not assess the amount of value, they do require the presence of legally \nrecognized value moving from the promisee to enforce a contract. \n \nTherefore, the statement implies that as long as there is something (no matter how small or \nseemingly insignificant) that both parties have agreed to exchange as part of their bargain, and it \nholds some economic or legal benefit/detriment, the courts will generally uphold it, reflecting the \nprinciple of freedom of contract. \n \n \nQuestion 9 \nWith the aid of decided cases, discuss comprehensively the concept of Cross-offer. \n \nAnswer \nThe concept of a cross-offer is a situation in contract law where two parties make identical offers \nto each other, but do so in ignorance of the other's offer. In such a scenario, no contract is formed \nbecause there is no acceptance of an offer; instead, there are merely two identical offers. \n \nA cross-offer occurs when an offer is made to another party in ignorance that the offeree has \nalready made an initial offer of the same facts, element, or condition to the offeror. It \nhappens when two offers, identical in terms, are sent by two parties to each other, for example, \nby post or any other means, and these offers “cross\" en route. In this instance, there is no \ncontract, as only two identical offers exist, with no corresponding acceptance. For a contract to \nemerge, there must be an offer by one party to the other, and the other party must react to that \noffer by indicating their acceptance. This fundamental requirement highlights the need for a \nmeeting of minds or consensus ad idem. \n \nThe core reason why cross-offers do not form a valid contract is the absence of mutual assent \n(acceptance). While both parties express a willingness to contract on specific terms, they do so \nindependently and without knowledge of the other's offer. Therefore, neither offer can be \nconstrued as an acceptance of the other. For a contract to be made, there must be two assenting \nminds, the parties agreeing in opinion and one having promised in consideration of the \npromise of the other; there is an exchange of promises. Exchanging offers made in ignorance \nof the other side's offer is not the same thing. \n \nIt is important to differentiate a cross-offer from a counter-offer. A counter-offer is an invalid \nform of acceptance that arises when the offeree introduces a variation to the terms of the initial \noffer. This new proposal, the counter-offer, effectively destroys the original offer, making it \nunavailable for acceptance. A cross-offer, however, involves two identical offers made \nsimultaneously and without knowledge of each other, rather than a response that varies the terms \nof an existing offer. \n \nThe classic case of Tinns v. Holfman illustrate the concept of cross-offers. In this case, Mr. \nHoffman wrote to Mr. Tinn offering to sell 800 tons of iron at 69 shillings per ton and requested \na reply by post. On the same day, Mr. Tinn, unaware of Hoffman's offer, also wrote to Mr. \nHoffman offering to buy the iron on similar terms. The letters \"crossed in the post\". \nThe court determined that no contract existed between Mr. Tinn and Mr. Hoffman. The offers \nwere made simultaneously and without each other's knowledge, meaning there was no \ncommunication that constituted an offer and acceptance. Blackburn J. clarified that while there \nis an exchange of promises in a contract, \"exchanging offers would, upon principle, be at all \nthe same thing\". \n \nIn conclusion, a cross-offer, while appearing to have mutual intent, fundamentally lacks the \nnecessary element of acceptance because neither party is responding to the other's offer. This \nprevents the formation of a legally binding contract, as there is no true \"meeting of the minds\". \n \n \nQuestion 10 \nBy its very nature, there is no limit to the number of people an offer can be made to. But a \ncontract comes into existence only between the offeror and the person(s) responding \npositively to the offer by way of acceptance. \nPer Bowen, L.J., in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball co. \nIn line with the above assertion, compare and contrast offer and invitation to treat. \n \nAnswer \nAn offer is a fundamental element in the formation of a contract. It is defined as an expression \nof willingness to contract on specific terms, made by one party (the offeror) to another (the \nofferee). For a proposal to constitute a valid offer, it must be a definite promise to be bound, \nprovided that certain specified terms are accepted. The offeror must have completed his share in \nthe formation of a contract by unequivocally declaring his readiness to undertake an obligation \nupon certain conditions, leaving to the offeree the option of acceptance or refusal. An offer must \nbe precise, unequivocal, unambiguous, and clear in terms of intent, giving no room for \nspeculation. It must also be communicated to the offeree. \n \nThe scope of an offer is broad. As stated, \"By its very nature, there is no limit to the number of \npeople an offer can be made to, but it is clear that a contract comes into existence only between \nthe offer and the person(s) responding to the offer and accepting it\". This principle was famously \ndemonstrated in Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. In this landmark case, Bowen L.J. clarified \nthat an offer can indeed be made \"to all the world,\" and it will \"ripen into a contract with \nanybody\" who performs the specified condition. Thus, while the offer may be universal, the \nresulting contract is formed only with that \"limited portion of the public who come forward \nand perform the condition on the faith of the advertisement\". Offers can be made orally, in \nwriting, or even implicitly through conduct, such as a bus stopping at a bus-stop to pick up \npassengers. \n \nIn contrast, an invitation to treat is not an offer that can be accepted to form a contract. Instead, \nit is a preliminary move in negotiations, acting as an invitation to negotiate, an invitation to \nmake an offer, or an invitation to \"chaffer\". It is a preliminary stage where one party invites \nanother party to make an offer.  \n \nSome examples of invitations to treat include: \nAuctions: An auctioneer's request for a bid is an invitation to treat; the bid itself constitutes the \noffer, and acceptance occurs when the auctioneer's hammer falls. \nDisplay of Goods: Goods displayed in shop windows with price tags or on shelves in a \nself-service store are generally considered invitations to treat. In such cases, the customer makes \nthe offer when presenting the goods at the cash desk, and the shopkeeper accepts or rejects it. \nThis was affirmed in cases of Fisher v. Bell and Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. \nBoots Cash Chemist. \n \nAdvertisements: While some advertisements can be offers especially those for unilateral \ncontracts, as seen in Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., most are generally invitations to treat. \nThis is particularly true for bilateral advertisements which are seen as leading to further \nbargaining. \nInvitations to Tender: When a party advertises for tenders, this is an invitation to treat, not an \noffer. The tenders submitted by contractors or suppliers are the actual offers, and acceptance \noccurs when the advertiser selects one or more of these tenders. \n \nThe key distinctions between an offer and an invitation to treat lie in their legal effect and the \nstage of negotiation they represent. An offer is a definite promise to be bound upon acceptance, \nand once accepted, it forms a legally binding contract. In contrast, an invitation to treat is not \ncapable of acceptance to create a contract. It merely invites others to make offers. \nAn offer expresses a clear intention by the offeror to be bound by specified terms. An invitation \nto treat is a mere declaration of negotiations, indicating a willingness to enter into negotiations \nrather than an immediate commitment to a contract. \nAn offer must be precise, unequivocal, and give no room for speculation. It is the final step by \nthe offeror, leaving only acceptance or refusal to the offeree. An invitation to treat, on the other \nhand, is characterized by wording that is not conclusive, and it is preliminary to the real offer, \noften leading to further bargaining. \nFor a contract to be enforceable, there must be a meeting of minds (consensus ad idem), where \nparties share a mutual understanding of the essential terms. An offer, when accepted, directly \nachieves this. An invitation to treat, by itself, does not establish this meeting of minds; it is a step \ntowards initiating the process that might eventually lead to it. The absence of a meeting of minds \nis why scenarios like cross-offers where two identical offers cross in ignorance of each other, as \nin Tinns v. Hoffman & Co. do not form a contract, as there is no acceptance. \n \nIn essence, while both concepts are part of the negotiation process, an offer is a commitment \nawaiting acceptance, whereas an invitation to treat is an open-ended communication that invites \noffers from others. \n \n \nAJAKAYE A.A", "filename": "fam\\Contract I Assignment GUIDE and ANSWERS.pdf"}

This principle ensures that \nindividuals and businesses retain control over their commercial dealings, fostering a legal \nenvironment that promotes predictability, autonomy, and fairness.The commercial and economic \nlife of our modern society consists very largely of agreements. Such that if those agreements are \nnot regulated by means of enforcement in law courts, trade and commerce would be chaotic. \nHence, a promisor won’t get away with a breach of an agreement without compensating the \naggrieved party for his loss. To ensure peace, order and the smooth efficient operation of trade \nand commerce, the law recognises the need for the satisfaction of reasonable and well-founded \nexpectations created by promises and agreements. The Supreme Court, through the judgment of \nKekere-Ekun JSC in Delmas v. Sunny Asitez International Ltd (2020), reaffirmed that no \nexternal entity, including the courts, has the authority to alter or impose terms on a contract that \nthe parties themselves have not agreed upon. This ruling highlights the respect the judiciary \naccords to the sanctity of contract, emphasizing that the role of the courts is primarily to enforce, \nnot to rewrite, agreements. This principle is deeply engraved in the doctrines of consensus and \nfreedom of contract, which prioritize the parties’ intentions and their capacity to freely negotiate \nterms that suit their individual needs and circumstances.At the heart of this freedom lies the \nfoundational concept of “Consensus ad Idem” (the meeting of minds), that for any contract to \nbe valid, both parties must fully understand and mutually agree upon the terms, ensuring that \ntheir intentions align.The commercial world depends heavily on such autonomy, as it allows for \nflexibility, innovation, and efficiency in business transactions. However, this freedom is not \nwithout limits; Nigerian courts recognize that party autonomy must be balanced against the \nrequirements of law, public policy, and fairness. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTHE CONSENSUS THEORY \nContracts arise from mutual consent, often described as the ‘meeting of minds’. Consensus \ntheory asserts that the essence of a valid contract is the genuine agreement between parties on \ntheir rights and obligations. It places paramount importance on the parties’ intentions, which \nmust be freely and voluntarily expressed. This theory supports the idea that once parties agree on \ncontract terms, those terms reflect their true will and must be respected. Nigerian courts adhere \nstrictly to this principle, refusing to rewrite or substitute agreed terms with their own \ninterpretations.“Consensus ad idem” or “meeting of the minds” is a common law concept that \nrequires both parties, entering into a contract, to have a common intention to accept and comply \nwith the terms outlined in the contract. It is a universal principle guiding all contracts all over the \nworld.  It has also been adopted into some state laws. For example, the Malaysian law, as seen in \nSection 13 of the Contracts Act 1950. The section provides that parties are said to consent to \nsomething ‘when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense.’ In other words, the meeting \nof minds takes place when both contracting parties fully understand and freely consent to \nundertake all contractual obligations upon entering a contract. This principle was further \nemphasised in the case of B.F.I GROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (2008) \nAll Federation Weekly Law Reports (All FWLR) Pt. 416 Pg. 1915 at P. 1937, paras E-H   \ngave a comprehensive explanation as follows: \n“A contract is an agreement between two or more parties which creates reciprocal legal \nobligation or obligations to do or not to do a particular thing. For a valid contract to be \nformed, there must be mutuality of purpose and intention. The two or more minds must \nmeet at the same point, event or incidents. They must be saying the same thing at the \nsame time. They must not be saying different things at different time. Where or when \nthey say a different thing at different times, they are not id idem and therefore no valid \ncontract is formed. The meeting of minds of the contracting parties is the most crucial \nand overriding factor or determinant in the law of contract. An agreement will not be \nbinding on the parties to it until their minds are at one both upon matters which are \ncardinal to the species of agreement in question and also upon matters that are part of \nthe particular bargain”.  \n \n \n This theory is crucial in forming contracts and ensures that parties are only bound by their \nmutually agreed-upon terms. It respects the autonomy of the parties and allows them to create \ntheir own contracts within the confines of the law. When interpreting contracts, the courts try to \nunderstand and enforce the parties' agreements, rather than to impose external standards. An \nexample of this is the stance of the adequacy of the consideration in a contractual agreement. The \ncourts do not nullify an agreement because there seems to be a disadvantaged party with regards \nto the bargains made. A decided case to this effect is that of Chappell v. Nestle. It is sufficient to \nthe courts, that the consideration is something of value in the eye of the law.  \nCONCEPT OF ‘CONSENT’ IN CONTRACT LAW \nContract only arises because of mutual expression of assent, this means, legal relations cannot \nexist except the parties intend them to. Contract law is basically about allowing parties to enter \narrangements on terms they choose. Each party imposing obligation on itself in return for \nobligation another party has placed upon itself. This freedom to contract; an ideal by which there \nare obligations to the extent, and only to the extent, that they are freely chosen by the parties, is \nwhat differentiates contract law from duties of Criminal law and Tort law, which bind all parties \nregardless of consent. Thus, consent in contract law has to do with the unequivocal, informed \nand voluntary agreement of a person to participate in an agreement or transaction and the \nwillingness to be bound by the terms agreed upon. It is the mutual understanding and agreement \nbetween parties involved in a contract. Contractual consent goes beyond mere agreement, it \nrequires a meeting of the minds where parties understand and accept the terms and conditions, \nfreely, without misapprehension or pressure. Consent is a fundamental principle that ensures \nfairness and justice in contractual relationships. For consent to be considered valid, the \ncontracting parties must first possess Legal capacity to enter into a contract, this requires that \nboth contracting parties have the capacity in age and mental fitness to enter into a binding \nagreement. Consent cannot be said to have been given when one of the contracting parties does \nnot possess the mental capacity to comprehend the implication of the terms (see Nash v Inman, \n[1908] 2 KB1).  The validity of contractual consent is also measured in the willingness and \nvoluntary assent to the terms of the agreement by the contracting parties. Assent by way of \nphysical threat or economic duress is not a valid form of consent and such contract could be void \nor voidable. To maintain the integrity of consensual agreement, it is essential that all parties enter \n \n \ninto it freely without any form of duress or manipulation. Barton v Armstrong [ 1976] AC 104, \nand Pao On & ors v Lau Yiu Long & anor [1980] AC 614) \nConversely, the knowledge of contractual terms is also pivotal. For consent to be considered \nvalid, it must be informed, each party must have full knowledge and a correct understanding of \nthe terms of the contract. Any form of Misrepresentation; which is a false statement that induces \na party to enter into a contract, (Derry v Peeks [1889] LR 14 App Cas 337, UK) or Mistake as \nregards the fundamental terms of the contract, (Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1932] AC 161) \npunctures the validity of the contractual agreement. Mutual agreement also stands as a factor that \naffects the validity of consent in an agreement. Contacting parties must mutually agree on all \nessential terms of the contract. This is known as consensus ad idem, which is “the meeting of \nthe minds of contracting parties.”   \nIt is not enough for one party to agree to certain terms, but, both parties must be at agreement in \nall terms constituting the contract. In the case of Best Nig Ltd v Blackwood Hodge Nig Ltd, \n[2011] 5 NWLR 95, Adekeye, JSC put it thus: “..The parties to the agreement must be in \nconsensus ad idem as regards the terms and conditions freely and voluntarily agreed upon by \nthem.” This was also established in Guarantee Trust Bank PLC v Udoka Anyanwu [2011] 46 \nWRN 159). \nConsent in contract is more than a mere procedural requirement, it is in fact, the very essence of \ncontractual legitimacy. It is what differentiates an enforceable contract from an unenforceable \ncontract. However, the court, in applying this broad conceptual theory of consent to real-world \nanalysis, has adopted an objective manifestation test, which relies on the outward manifestation \nof intent as measured objectively from the point of view of the other contracting party, this is \nknown as the “reasonable person's” standard. It connotes that, if a reasonable person should \nexamine the contractual relationship, such person will be able to testify that consent has indeed \nbeen given or manifested. Therefore, for consent to be said to have been manifested, it must be \noutwardly expressed and must be unequivocal and not subjective. See (Lucy v Zehmer 196 Va. \n493; 84 S.E. 2d 516. \n \n \n \n \n \n FREEDOM TO CONTRACT \nThe doctrine of freedom of contract is a foundational principle in contract law, expressing the \nliberty of individuals to choose whether to contract, with whom, and under what terms. It grants \nparties the autonomy to negotiate and structure agreements in a manner that reflects their mutual \nintentions and needs. This autonomy is crucial for upholding private relationships and promoting \nlegal certainty.The most basic rule in common law as regards contractual agreement is that when \ntwo parties of full capacity enter into an agreement (contract) of their own free will, the court \nwill not intervene in such dealings unless there is a compelling reason for such intervention. This \nis what the whole doctrine of freedom to contract is based on the idea that once a party to a \ncontract have the \"full\" capacity to enter into such contract, the court has no reason to involve \nherself in such a contract.The doctrine encompasses several key elements, including the freedom \nto choose whether to  contract,choose the terms of the contract and choose the other party.The \nreason for this is not far-fetched at all. It is based on the fact that the court is not a meddlesome \ninterloper and it is only a party to a contract that knows what is best for himself/ herself. If the \ncourt were to be the one who draws up terms of a contract on behalf of the contracting parties, \nsuch parties may subsequently claim that such terms is non-est factum (not my deed) and many \nwould try to run under this factor to keep being mischievous. Therefore, the court does not on \nany account draw up a contract for the contracting parties. \nIn Delmas v. Sunny Asitez Int’l Ltd, (2020) All FWLR (Pt. 1026) 541. Kekere-Ekun JSC \nupheld this principle, holding that once parties agree on the terms of their contract, neither the \ncourt nor a third party may vary those terms. This judicial approach reinforces the idea that \ncontract law is meant to respect the sanctity of voluntary agreements.The principle of “Freedom \nto contract” arose again in BFI Group Corp. v. Bureau of Public Enterprises and the \nSupreme Court once again emphasised its sacrosanct character in the strongest terms as follows:     \n         \n“It must be reiterated here that the court must treat as sacrosanct the terms of an \nagreement freely entered into by the parties. This is because parties to a contract enjoy their \nfreedom to contract or their own terms so long as same is lawful. The terms of a contract \nbetween parties are clothed with some degree of sanctity and if any question should arise with \n \n \nregard to the contract, the terms in any document which constitutes the contract are invariably \nthe guide to its interpretation. When parties enter into a contract, they are bound by the terms \nof the contract as set out by them. It is not the business of the court to rewrite a contract for \nthe parties. See, Afrotech Services Nig. Ltd. v. M.A & Sons Ltd (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.692) 720 \nat 788.” \nHowever, this strict rule of law is shrouded with numerous exceptions which shall be considered \none after the other. Although it has been stated earlier that all individuals has the freedom to \ncontract, not all individuals with this freedom have the capacity to contract. The law allows for \nall individuals to contract whenever they want to but the law as a need for protection of some \ngroups have exempted some certain classes of people from entering into a contractual agreement \nbecause their circumstances can easily be exploited or defrauded while making bargains. This \nprotected group include; infants, lunatics, drunkards, and illiterates.  \nThe concept of freedom of contract developed during the 19th century in tandem with \nlaissez-faire economics, which advocated minimal state interference.Scholars like Samuel \nWilliston emphasized that contractual obligations stem from the voluntary consent of parties and \nmust be enforced objectively. In The Law of Contracts, Williston maintained that courts must \nprioritize the intentions of the parties, rather than fairness or outcomes. Sir John Salmond, a \nrenowned legal theorist, similarly viewed contracts as the result of the will of the parties, and \nthus enforceable only when that will is clearly expressed.His definition of a contract as “an \nagreement creating and defining obligations between parties” highlights the personal and \nconsensual nature of contractual relations.Judicial support for this philosophy can be seen in \nPrinting and Numerical Registering Co. v. Sampson(1875) LR 19 Eq 462,where Jessel MR \nstated that “contracts voluntarily entered into shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by \nthe courts of justice.” \nIn contemporary commercial practice, freedom of contract retains critical importance. It provides \npredictability and flexibility in business relationships, allowing parties to allocate risks and \nresponsibilities. In Afrotec Tech Services (Nig.) Ltd v. MIA & Sons Ltd (2000) 15 NWLR \n(Pt. 692) 730, the Nigerian Supreme Court confirmed that parties are bound by the terms of their \nagreement and that the courts will not relieve a party simply because those terms later appear \nburdensome.Similarly, in Best (Nig.) Ltd. v. Blackwood Hodge (Nig.) Ltd (2011) 5 NWLR \n \n \n(Pt. 1239) 95, the court reiterated that the judiciary must not interfere with contracts by \nintroducing unintended terms. Courts have also consistently stressed that, unless a contract is \nillegal or contrary to public policy, it should be enforced as it is. This was the position in Orient \nBank \n(Nig.) Plc v. Bilante Int’l Ltd (1997) 8 NWLR (Pt. 515) 37, where the sanctity of contract \nwas upheld.Nonetheless, modern developments have introduced limitations to ensure equity. \nThe doctrines of illegality, duress, unconscionability, and public policy now moderate the rigid \napplication of contractual freedom, particularly in cases involving unequal bargaining power. \nFrom a jurisprudential standpoint, Williston advocated for judicial deference to the freely \nexpressed intentions of the parties.In the same vein, Salmond emphasized that legal obligations \nshould only arise where parties intentionally create them.In the Nigerian context, legal scholars \nlike Obilade have noted that respect for contractual autonomy supports commerce and reinforces \nthe rule of law. Nigerian courts have maintained this stance, provided that such contracts do not \ncontravene statutory or equitable doctrines.The doctrine of freedom of contract remains central \nto the structure of modern contract law, particularly in commercial transactions. While rooted in \nclassical liberalism, contemporary applications of the doctrine are tempered by legal safeguards \nto prevent abuse. Nigerian courts have embraced a balanced approach upholding autonomy while \nrecognizing statutory and moral boundaries. As long as contracts are entered into freely and \nlawfully, their sanctity continues to be preserved in Nigeria's legal system. \n \n \n \nJUDICIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS PARTY AUTONOMY \nParty autonomy refers to the principle that parties to a contract or legal agreement have the \nfreedom to determine the terms, conditions, and governing law of their relationship, provided \nsuch choices are lawful and do not violate public policy. The judicial attitude toward party \nautonomy varies across jurisdictions, legal systems, and contexts, such as commercial contracts, \narbitration, and family law, but courts generally uphold this principle with certain \n \n \nlimitations.Courts worldwide tend to respect party autonomy as a cornerstone of private law, \nparticularly in commercial and contractual settings. This reflects the principle of freedom of \ncontract, which assumes that rational parties are best positioned to determine their mutual \nobligations. Key aspects include contractual freedom, choice of law, and jurisdiction. For \nexample, in Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd (1934) the court enforced an agreement despite \nvague terms, emphasizing the parties' intent to be bound. Similarly, courts generally respect the \nparties' choice of governing law and forum in international contracts.While courts generally \nfavor party autonomy, they impose restrictions to protect public policy, mandatory laws, and \nvulnerable parties. These limitations reflect a balance between individual freedom and societal \ninterests. Key constraints include public policy, mandatory laws, unequal bargaining power, \nthird-party rights, and procedural fairness in arbitration. For instance, courts may refuse to \nenforce agreements that contravene fundamental principles of justice or morality, such as \ncontracts promoting illegal activities.The judicial approach to party autonomy varies depending \non the legal context. In commercial contracts, courts adopt a laissez-faire attitude, presuming \nparties are sophisticated and capable of negotiating fair terms. In family law, party autonomy is \nmore restricted due to public interest in protecting vulnerable parties, such as spouses and \nchildren. In arbitration, courts strongly defer to party autonomy, reflecting the consensual nature \nof the process.Judicial attitudes toward party autonomy differ across legal traditions. Common \nlaw jurisdictions, such as the UK and US, emphasize freedom of contract but intervene in cases \nof fraud, duress, or unconscionability. Civil law jurisdictions, such as France and Germany, \nrecognize party autonomy but subject it to stricter statutory limits. Islamic law also recognizes \nparty autonomy but constrains it by Sharia principles.Recent trends show courts adapting their \napproach to party autonomy in response to globalization and societal changes. With \nglobalization, courts are more willing to uphold choice-of-law and arbitration clauses to facilitate \ncross-border trade. Courts are also increasingly vigilant in protecting consumers and \nemployees,reflecting societal emphasis on fairness. The emergence of blockchain-based smart \ncontracts raises new challenges, and courts are grappling with whether to enforce automated \nagreements that may lack traditional consent elements. \nThe judicial attitude toward party autonomy reflects a tension between individual freedom and \nsocietal regulation. While autonomy promotes efficiency and respects private ordering, \nunchecked freedom risks exploitation and undermines mandatory norms. Courts' pragmatic \n \n \napproach, upholding autonomy but policing its limits, strikes a reasonable balance but can lead to \ninconsistency across jurisdiction.In conclusion, judicial attitudes toward party autonomy are \ngenerally supportive, particularly in commercial and arbitration contexts, where courts prioritize \ncontractual freedom and predictability. However, this support is tempered by limitations to \nprotect public policy, mandatory laws, and vulnerable parties. As globalization and technology \nreshape legal relationships, courts continue to refine their stance, balancing respect for party \nautonomy with the need for fairness and justice. \n \n \n \n \n \nROLES OF THE COURT IN CONTRACTUAL INTERPRETATION AND CONTRACT \nCREATIONS. \nThe doctrine of freedom of contract implies the ability of parties to bargain and create the terms \nof their agreement without interference. See in the case of Lochner v. Newyork.It means parties \ncan independently and fairly negotiate and set their own responsibilities without the \ngovernment's restrictions. However this freedom is conditioned by factors like if the activities \nare legal, If the parties have right to freely enter into the contract and right to negotiate and \nterminate contracts.People are free to decide whether to enter into a contract, choose whom to \ncontract with and set the terms and conditions.The doctrine became the strongest during the \nLaissez faire era of the 1800s. One of the key cases in this era was Printing and Numerical \nRegistering co v. Sampson.Though as the society changed in the 20th century, limitations like \nlabour laws, minimum wage and consumer protection laws were introduced. \nContract creation can be defined as the state where parties negotiate, agree and form a contract. \nThis means that an agreement between two parties based on their terms and conditions usually \nembodies all the elements of contract.It is important to emphasize that Courts do not create \n \n \ncontracts, it is not its job to write or impose contracts for the parties. Parties themselves must \nvoluntarily enter into the agreements and for this to happen there has to be “consensus ad idem” \ni.e meeting of minds of the parties. The things a court could do include; \n●​ Determination of the validity of the contract which involves examining whether the \nessential elements of contract formation like offer, acceptance, consideration, \nintention to enter into legal relations and capacity are present. See in the case of Felt \nhouse v. Bindley where there was no acceptance in the contract to make it valid. \n●​ The court could also decide whether the agreement is enforceable which requires \nanalysing the contract to see if it has elements of duress, undue influence, \nmisrepresentation, mistake or illegality. \n●​ The court could also imply terms only when necessary. For example courts may \nimply a term that goods sold must be of satisfactory quality (under law) . \nThe Role of contractual interpretation arises for the court when the court is asked to determine \nwhat the contract means and how it should be applied. The court’s role is to interpret the words \nused in the contract not rewrite them and to determine the intention of the parties.When there is a \ncontract relating to any arrangement between the parties, the main duty of the court is to interpret \nthat contract and give effect to the wishes of the parties as expressed in the contract document.It \nis the law that parties to an agreement retain the commercial freedom to determine the \nterms, no other person. Not even the court can determine the terms of a contract between \nparties thereto. The duty of the court is to strictly interpret its clear wordings.In Conoil plc \nv. Vitol SA, the supreme court justices were unanimous on the contractual effect of a choice of \ncourse agreement. Nwese JSC in his leading statement stated that; “In all, the truth remains \nthat if parties enter into an agreement, they are bound by its terms”The motion of not being \nable to interfere or rewrite the contracts by the court implies the documentation of freedom of \ncontract which protects the parties from unnecessary external influence.Adekeye JSC gave his \nview in Best Nig. Ltd v. Blackwood Hodge that “...parties to the agreement must be in \nconsensus ad idem as regards the terms and conditions freely and voluntarily agreed upon \nby them”. This is to say the court won't interfere in the contract.Interfering in the contract and \nreading into  it beyond what is expressly stated  by the courts amounts to disrupting the sanctity \nof the contract. This question of sanctity of contract was raised in the case of BFI Group corp v. \n \n \nBureau of public enterprises and the supreme court again emphasized its sacrosanct character in \nthe strongest terms. In the interpretation of contracts,there are some key principles which the \ncourt makes use of. They will be discussed briefly as follows;  \n●​ Literal rule:This is a method of interpretation where the court gives the words of a \nstatute or contract their plain, ordinary and grammatical meaning even if the result seems \nharsh or undesirable. Here the court does not try to guess the parties’ intention beyond the \nwords used. No interpretation is added or changed. This approach respects the idea that \nthe words used reflect the will of the parliament in statutes or the parties in the contract. \nSee in the case of Adegbenro v. Akintola. \n●​ Golden Rule: The literal rule led  to the establishment of the Golden rule. This is \nbecause the absolute application of the literal rule might result in absurdity or \nunreasonability hence the Golden rule was established. It is used when there is a clear or \ngross balance of anomaly and the language of the statutes is susceptible to the \nmodifications required to obtain the anomaly. \nAn example is the case of the Council of the University of Ibadan v.Adamolekun. Its purpose \nis to prevent injustice or absurd outcomes that may arise from the strict application of the literal \nrule. \n●​ Mischief Rule: This is also referred to as “Interpretation by reference to statutory \npurpose”. This is the rule that considers the statutory purpose and historical antecedent in \nmaking the state. The Court's opinion is that no meaning should be given to a statute \nwhich is contrary to the intention of the legislature. Reference is therefore made to the \nstate of the law prior to the enactment of the statute to discern what shortcomings in the \nold law, the new law had come to cure. This method was laid down in Heydon's case. \nHowever the limitation of this rule is that its premise starts on a false note and fails to lay \ndown any clear test of construing actual words used by the parliament.  \nThe above rules are the convenient rules of practice designed over time to assist courts in \ninterpretation of statutes. \n \n \n \n \nLIMITS OF PARTY AUTONOMY \nWhile contract law emphasises the autonomy of the parties to choose their terms, there are some \nsets of restrictions, i.e. mandatory rules. These are the “rules of the game” which the parties have \nnot chosen, and most of which are not within the powers of the parties to disregard or waive by \nagreement. These kinds of rules are mostly showing the limitations of autonomy of contract, that \nthere are terms, consequently the whole agreement, that the law will not enforce, even though the \nparties have consented to them. The Rome convention has certain provisions which limits the \nparty autonomy and more specifically these provisions are article 5 and 6 which relate to \nconsumer contracts and individual contracts of the employment and these provisions have the \neffect of either limiting the ambit of general choice of law provisions or excluding the provisions \nand this limitation was not the part of the preexisting English Conflict of laws rules. \nThe limitations on autonomy of contract are, in one or another way, interferes with a person’s \nliberty of action justified by reasons referring exclusively to the welfare, good, happiness, needs, \ninterests, or values of the person being misinformed, deceived, coerced or else ( The \ninterference is either by preventing the person from doing whatever he has decided to do, \nor by interfering with how he reaches his decision). Arguments in favour of limitations in \ncontracts are based on the idea that not only legal norms matter, rather, social norms do, and \nshould, regulate which business practices are considered fair and socially acceptable Major \nlimitations to party autonomy can follow from the arbitration agreement itself, implications of \napplicable mandatory rules or laws, rules of arbitral institutions, intervention of courts in cases of \nbias of arbitrators, misconduct of proceedings etc. Important restrictions can additionally follow \nfrom “public policy”. This restriction owes its existence to the concept of state sovereignty; thus, \nevery state can demarcate the boundaries within which arbitration can take place. This concept \ndepends on the cultural, social and economic traditions of each country.Public policy can \ninfluence party autonomy in three ways: first, the freedom of the parties can be limited by the \nrules governing the arbitrability of the arbitration agreement, second, an  award can be set \naside if it violates public policy and third, if the award infringers public policy its \nrecognition and enforcement can be refused.Natural justice is a further limitation to party \nautonomy, because if the parties’ agreement violates natural justice it cannot be enforced. \n \n \nAnother restriction is imposed by the role of national courts because they follow the procedural \nlaw of the country concerned even if not agreed to by the parties.Another limitation is that the \nlink to substantive and procedural law, the freedom of the parties to tailor proceedings to their \nneeds, also has other restrictions, eg, when parties attempt to alter the rules of the administering \nbody in a way which is unworkable or is not accepted by the administering body. Further, the \narbitration agreement must be a valid one according to the law which governs it. In addition, the \narbitral procedure itself should comply with the mandatory rules of law of the “lex arbitri”, \nwhich usually is the law of the place of the seat of the arbitration.Intervention of the court might \nplace Special restrictions on party autonomy, especially during expedited procedures provided \nunder the rules of various arbitration institutions. As an example, the ICC, HKIAC and SIAC \nRules shall be reviewed in this respect. \n    \nIn conclusion,The principle of party autonomy is based on the freedom to contract. \nLimitations to party autonomy are due to the number and variety of stakeholders, who range \nfrom the parties themselves, the arbitrators, the legal institutions(court), and, last but not least, \nthe public at large. \nThe parties can only exercise their party autonomy as far as public policy and the “lex arbitri” \nallow. National law defines what may be subject to arbitration, when an award is deemed to \nconflict with public policy, what the criteria are for an arbitration agreement to be binding on the \nparties, what mandatory rules of procedure apply, and when an award is valid.Furthermore, the \ncontract agreement binds only the parties to this agreement, so that third-party involvement may \nbe another limitation.Depending on the situation, different restrictions on party autonomy may \nresult before the establishment of the arbitral tribunal and after that. Before the beginning of the \narbitration, some restrictions regarding the drafting of the agreement may apply. Autonomy of \nparties, though fundamental, isn't without restrictions. \n \nCOMPARATIVE JURISPRUDENCE \nComparative jurisprudence is a crucial field of legal study that involves comparing different legal \nsystems to identify similarities, differences, and the underlying principles that shape them. In \nNigeria, a country with a multi-faceted legal system, comparative jurisprudence is particularly \n \n \nrelevant.The Nigerian legal system is a fascinating mix of different legal traditions. The main \ncomponents are English Common Law, Customary Law, and Sharia Law. English Common \nLaw forms the foundation of the Nigerian legal system, particularly in the Southern states, and is \nbased on judicial precedent and case law. Customary Law, on the other hand, is a body of \nunwritten rules and practices that govern the lives of various ethnic groups in Nigeria. Sharia \nLaw is applicable in many Northern states and governs both civil and criminal matters for \nMuslims.Comparative jurisprudence is applied in Nigeria in several ways. It is used in legal \ndevelopment and reform, judicial decision-making, academic and scholarly research, \ninternational law and human rights, and constitutional interpretation. By comparing Nigerian law \nwith other jurisdictions, Nigeria can identify best practices and reform its laws to enhance \nefficiency, address contemporary issues, and align with international standards. \n    \nDespite the benefits of comparative jurisprudence, its application in Nigeria faces some \nchallenges. The diversity of legal systems, cultural context, and access to information can make \ncomparison complex. However, the prospects for comparative jurisprudence in Nigeria are \nsignificant. As a globalized world, Nigeria's legal system is increasingly intertwined with \ninternational commerce, human rights, and other global issues. The conscious adoption of a \ncomparative approach in legal education, research, and judicial practice can lead to a more \nrobust, effective, and globally relevant legal system in Nigeria.In conclusion, comparative \njurisprudence is a vital field of study in Nigeria, offering numerous benefits and opportunities for \ngrowth. By embracing comparative jurisprudence, Nigeria can develop a more effective and \nglobally relevant legal system that addresses the needs of its diverse population and promotes \njustice and fairness. \n \n \nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF CONTRACT  \nThe doctrine of freedom of contract has significant policy implications that shape the way \nbusinesses operate and interact with each other. One of the key implications is that it encourages \ncommercial certainty and autonomy. By allowing businesses to operate with confidence, \nknowing that their negotiated agreements will be enforced, the doctrine facilitates complex \n \n \ncommercial arrangements tailored to specific needs. This, in turn, promotes economic growth \nand development.Furthermore, the doctrine of freedom of contract reduces judicial activism by \nlimiting the role of courts in interfering with private bargains. Judges are not meant to make \ncontracts for parties, which restrains the judiciary from being overly subjective and preserves \npredictability in commercial transactions. This is evident in cases such as Union Bank v. Umeh \nwhere the court confirmed that judges should not interfere with the terms of a contract agreed \nupon by the parties.Additionally, the doctrine of freedom of contract encourages diligence in \nnegotiation by placing the burden on parties to ensure fair terms. Once parties agree on terms, \nthey are stuck with them, even if they later regret it. This places a higher duty on parties to \nnegotiate carefully, read terms, and seek legal advice before signing. As seen in Koiki v. \nMagnusson the courts will generally uphold the terms of a contract, even if one party later \nclaims that they did not fully understand or appreciate the implications of the agreement. \n  In conclusion, the doctrine of freedom of contract has significant policy implications that \npromote commercial certainty, autonomy, and predictability in business transactions. By \nunderstanding these implications, businesses and individuals can navigate the complexities of \ncontract law and make informed decisions that promote their interests. \n \n \n \nNIGERIAN COMMERCIAL REALITIES \nNigeria's commerce landscape is shaped by several realities. Inadequate infrastructure, such as \npoor roads and unreliable electricity, hinders trade and commerce. Complex regulations and \nbureaucratic processes create challenges for businesses, while corruption increases costs and \nundermines trust.The market is influenced by global trends, exchange rates, and trade policies, \nwith the economy heavily reliant on oil exports. The informal sector plays a significant role, \nproviding employment and income for many Nigerians. E-commerce growth is driven by \nincreasing internet penetration, but infrastructure challenges hinder its development.These \nrealities impact businesses operating in Nigeria, affecting their efficiency, costs, and profitability. \n \n \nUnderstanding these challenges is crucial for promoting economic growth and development in \nthe country. At the core of these is the Contract. There's no way we can discuss commercial \nactivities without mentioning it. It's an important element in both the private and public sector. \nThere are Legislations, however, implemented to regulate contracts as it relates to commercial \nrealities in Nigeria. In this essay we would be discussing some legislation that addresses these \ncommercial realities in relation to freedom of contract. \n       \nCorruption is a significant challenge in Nigeria's business environment. The Corrupt \nPractices and Other Related Offences Act 2000 establishes the Economic and Financial \nCrimes Commission (EFCC) and provides penalties for corrupt practices. The EFCC is \nempowered to investigate and prosecute corruption cases, and the Act prescribes penalties for \nindividuals and organizations found guilty of corruption. The Money Laundering (Prohibition) \nAct 2011 prohibits money laundering and provides penalties for individuals and organizations \ninvolved in money laundering activities. These laws aim to promote transparency and \naccountability in business transactions.Currency fluctuations are another reality that affects \nbusinesses operating in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria Act 2007 establishes the Central \nBank of Nigeria (CBN) as the apex regulatory authority for monetary policy. The CBN is \nempowered to regulate foreign exchange transactions, and the Act provides for the management \nof foreign exchange reserves. The Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous \nProvisions) Act 1995 regulates foreign exchange transactions and provides for penalties for \nunauthorized foreign exchange transactions. These legislations aim to stabilize the naira and \nfacilitate foreign exchange transactions. \nRegulatory challenges are also a significant reality in Nigeria's business environment. The \nNigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act 1995 promotes and regulates investments in \nNigeria. The Act provides for the protection of investments and guarantees investors' rights. The \nCompanies and Allied Matters Act 2020 regulates companies and business operations in \nNigeria, providing for the incorporation, management, and winding up of companies. These \nlegislations aim to promote investments and simplify business operation.In contrast, e-commerce \ngrowth is a positive reality in Nigeria's business landscape. The National Information \nTechnology Development Agency Act 2007 promotes and regulates information technology \ndevelopment. The Act provides for the development of IT infrastructure and the promotion of \n \n \ne-commerce. The Cybeercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act 2015 addresses cybercrime \nand electronic transactions, providing for the security and integrity of electronic transactions. \nThese legislations aim to facilitate e-commerce growth and provide a framework for electronic \ntransaction.Import dependencies are another reality that affects Nigeria's business environment. \nThe Customs and Excise Tariff (Consolidation) Act 2004 regulates customs and excise duties, \nproviding for the levy and collection of duties on imported goods. The Nigerian Export-Import \nBank Act 1991 provides financing for export-import activities, aiming to promote trade and \nfacilitate \nimports. \nThese \nlegislations \naim \nto \npromote \ntrade \nand \nreduce \nimport \ndependencies.Finally, the informal economy is a significant reality in Nigeria's business \nlandscape. The National Minimum Wage Act 2019 sets minimum wage standards for workers, \naiming to protect workers' rights. The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in \nPersons (NAPTIP) Act 2003 addresses human trafficking and forced labor, providing for the \nprotection of workers' rights. These legislations aim to formalize the informal economy and \npromote decent work. \n      \nIn conclusion, Nigeria's commercial realities are shaped by a complex array of factors, \nincluding corruption, currency fluctuations, regulatory challenges, e-commerce growth, import \ndependencies, and the informal economy. The legislation addressing these realities aim to \npromote transparency, stability, and growth in Nigeria's business environment. While freedom of \ncontract is important, it is also essential to note that it's regulated by these legislations to prevent \ninfringement of the law. By understanding these legislations and realities, businesses, \npolicymakers, and investors can navigate Nigeria's market and contribute to the country's \neconomic development. \nEXCEPTIONS TO THE  FREEDOM OF CONTRACT (WILL THEORY) \n \nWhen discussing the Will Theory in contract law, we delve into circumstances where a contract, \neven though formed by mutual agreement, may not be enforceable due to certain vitiating \nfactors. The Will Theory posits that contracts are the result of parties exercising their free will, \nbut this principle is not absolute. There are key exceptions where the parties' consent is \ncompromised, or the contract itself is rendered void or voidable. These exceptions include: \nIllegality, Mistake, Duress and Undue influence.  \n \n \n \nIllegal and void contracts \nThere is no precise definition of illegal contracts. However, according to Anson, where an \nagreement is invalidated either by express statutory enactment or by rules of common law, it is \nillegal. Also, where the law will not aid a claimant in a situation where the law states that such \nagreement is not to have legal effect, the agreement is void. Therefore, illegal and void contracts \nare not enforceable and both terms are used interchangeably by judges. Thus, these contracts will \nbe classified into three: \n1.​\nContracts illegal by statute; \n2.​\nContracts illegal at common law; and \n3.​\nContracts void at common law \n \na)​ Contracts Illegal By Statute \nContracts can be illegal by statute due to express prohibition, regulation of trade/profession, \nprotection of a class/public, or revenue raising. \nExamples: \n●​ Express prohibition of certain types of contracts: Sodipo v. Lemminkaimen [1986] 1 \nN.W.L.R. (Pt. 15) P.220 at 238 \n●​ The regulation of a particular trade, profession or dealing in a particular commodity or \nresource: Solanke v. Abed [1962] N.R.N.L.R. 92  \n●​ Protection of a class, or the public, or the promotion of an object of public policy: Osefo \nv. Uwania [1971] (1) A.L.R. 421  \n●​ Revenue raising statutes: Smith v. Mawhood (1845) 14 M. & W. 452 (contracts violating \nrevenue-raising statutes may not be illegal if the intention isn't to defraud the revenue) \n \nb)​ Contracts Illegal at Common Law \nThe contents of this category of illegality have been determined by the Courts of England over \nthe centuries. Although minor changes have occurred in the list of contracts affected, the binding \nlink between all of them is that they are forbidden by the common law on grounds of public \npolicy. They are generally grouped into the following: \n●​ Committing a crime/tort/fraud (Allen v. Rescous [1676] 2 Lev. 174) \n \n \n●​ Prejudicing marriage (Alake v. Chief Oderinlo, High Court of Western State, \nAbeokuta Judicial Division, Agbaje, J. , Suit No. 23A/74 delivered on January 24, \n1975. Casebook, p. 369. \n●​ Threatening public safety (contracts with enemy countries) \n●​ Impeding justice (R. v. Panayiotou [1973] 3 All E.R. 112) \n●​ Promoting corruption (Montifiore v. Menday Motor Co. Limited [1918] 2 K.B. 241) \n●​ Defrauding revenue (contracts involving misrepresentation) \n \nc)​ Contracts Void at Common Law \n    Contracts regarded as void in common law as opposed to those that are both illegal and void \nare 3 in number. They are: \n●​ Ousting court jurisdiction (arbitration clauses are allowed) \n●​ Sexual immorality (Upfill v. Wright [1911] 1 K. B. 506) \n●​ Restraint of trade (valid if reasonable and justifiable) \n \n \nMistake \nCertain factors can nullify a contract’s legal validity. One of the factors that can ruin something \nis mistakes. A misunderstanding about the terms of a contract releases a party from their \nresponsibilities under that contract. The legal definition of mistake in contract law is more \nlimited compared to how a non-expert perceives a mistake. What might be seen as an error by an \nordinary person is often not viewed as a mistake in the legal field. A mistake occurs when either \nparty can cancel a contract because if they had been aware of the true facts, they wouldn’t have \nagreed to it. Lord Atkin provided practical examples to explain the concept of mistake in the case \nof Bell v Lever Bros Ltd, [1932] A.C. 161 \n \n●​ Types of Mistakes: \no​ Common Mistake: Both parties share the same incorrect assumption about a key fact. \no​ Mutual Mistake: Both parties have different understandings of the contract terms. \no​ Unilateral Mistake: Only one party is mistaken, often due to misrepresentation or fraud. \n Examples: \n \n \n-​\nBell v Lever Bros Ltd [1932] A.C. 161: A buys a horse, painting, or property \nwithout knowing their true condition. A cannot seek a solution unless there's \nmisrepresentation or warranty. \n-​\nCunday v. Lindsay (1873) 3 A.C. 459; 38 L.T. 573: A swindler buys goods under \na false identity. The contract is void due to unilateral mistakes. \n Note: The law doesn't consider the quality of the content unless explicitly communicated. \nMistake is only recognized if the object of the agreement doesn't exist. \n \nDuress and Undue Influence \nAn individual who agrees to an offer in a contract is typically obligated by that agreement. \nNevertheless, there are certain circumstances in which a party who has agreed to a contract may \nbe able to avoid being held accountable for their obligations. The presence of duress and undue \ninfluence in a contract can enable a party to escape binding contractual liability. \n \n●​ Duress in Common law: Initially limited to physical harm or imprisonment, now includes \neconomic duress and duress involving goods. \n \nTypes of duress \n●​ Duress against a person (violence, threats, or coercion) Barton v. Armstrong [1976] 2 \nW.L.R. 1050: Threats to kill can void a contract, even if not the sole reason for entering \ninto it. \n \n●​ Duress of goods (withholding or threatening to withhold goods) Skeate v. Beale [1840] \n11 A. & E. 983: Initially, holding someone's belongings unlawfully was not considered \nduress, but later cases have criticized this decision. Maskell v. Herbert [1915] 3 K.B. \n106: Coercion regarding goods can void a contract. \n \n●​ Economic duress (using economic influence to force contract terms) \nSibeon v. Sibotre [1976] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 293: Economic duress can include threats to \ndestroy property or harm someone's business. \n \n \n \nUndue Influence \nBecause the common law of duress has a limited scope, equity created a more comprehensive \ndoctrine of undue influence that surpasses duress in common law. While the phrase “undue \ninfluence” is widely recognized, courts have not yet offered a specific definition for it. Questions \narise about whether “undue” signifies illegitimate or excessive, and whether influence refers to \npressure or something more subtle. \n \nLindley L.J. provided an early definition of undue influence in Alcard v. Skinner [1887] 36 \nCh.D. 145, characterizing it as “unfair or improper behaviour, external coercion, or personal \ngain for the guilty party.” Undue influence arises in two situations: \n \n1. In cases where a unique bond does not exist. \n2. In the presence of a unique connection \n \nFactors which tend to influence the court on whether or not the contract should be set aside \ninclude the following: \n•​\nThe substantive unfairness of the contract. \n•​\nAny unfairness in the negotiating process. \n•​\nWeakness or disability on the part of the person seeking to enforce the contract. \n•​\nWrongdoing on the part of the person seeking to enforce the contract. \n•​\nLack of independent advice. \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn conclusion,The principle that \"parties to an agreement retain the commercial freedom to \ndetermine their own terms and no other person, not even the court can determine the terms \nof the contract between them\" is a cornerstone of contract law in Nigeria. This principle was \naptly stated by Kekere-Ekun JSC in Delmas v. Sunny Asitez Int'l Ltd (2020) All FWLR pt. \n1026 at 541, paras: B-C.The essence of this principle is that parties have the autonomy to \nnegotiate and agree on terms that suit their interests, without external interference. This means \nthat courts cannot impose terms on parties or rewrite contracts to make them more reasonable or \nfair. Instead, the court's role is to interpret and enforce the terms of the contract as agreed upon \nby the parties. By upholding this principle, courts can promote certainty and stability in \ncommercial transactions, and ensure that parties are held to the terms they agree to. the \nconsensus theory and will theory, as encapsulated in the quote from CDB Plc. v. Arc. Mfon \nEkanem and Ors. (2009) 6 NWLR 585, though distinct, are integral components of modern \ncontract law. The consensus theory, emphasizing the meeting of minds and mutual agreement, \nprovides a foundation for contractual relationships. Meanwhile, the will theory, highlighting \nindividual autonomy and freedom to contract, underscores the importance of party intention and \nconsent. \nTogether, these theories shape our understanding of contractual principles, influencing the \nformation, interpretation, and enforcement of contracts. However, their limitations and \nexceptions; including issues of manipulation, misunderstanding, and external factors necessitate \na complex approach. \nAs contract law continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize the interplay between consensus \nand will, balancing the need for mutual agreement with the importance of individual autonomy. \nThis balanced approach must also consider the impact of external factors, such as social and \neconomic dynamics, on contractual relationships. \nUltimately, a comprehensive understanding of contract law requires acknowledging the \ncomplexities and subtleties of both consensus and will theories. By embracing this nuanced \nperspective, we can foster a more effective and equitable contract law system that prioritizes \nfairness, clarity, and mutual understanding, ultimately promoting trust and cooperation in \ncontractual relationships. \n \n \n \nReferences \n- Durojaye, E.

But a \ncontract comes into existence only between the offeror and the person(s) responding \npositively to the offer by way of acceptance. \nPer Bowen, L.J., in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball co. \nIn line with the above assertion, compare and contrast offer and invitation to treat.​\n​\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe formation of a contract is not always as simple or clear-cut as it appears. There are instances \nwhere one party claims that a contract has been formed, only for it to be revealed that no legally \nbinding agreement actually exists. A significant factor contributing to contractual disputes that \nend up in court is the general public's lack of understanding regarding the crucial difference \nbetween an offer and an invitation to treat. Without this clarity, parties may mistakenly believe a \nbinding agreement exists when, legally, it does not. A classic illustration of this can be found in \nthe landmark case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893), where Bowen LJ made a \nstatement that has echoed through the halls of contract law for over a century. \n \n“There is no limit to the number of people to whom an offer may be made. But a contract \nonly comes into existence between the person making the offer and the person who accepts \nit.” \n \nThis deceptively simple statement captures the core of contract formation. The moment when \nlaw begins to hold two parties accountable to their words. Yet, before a contract can arise, there \nmust first be an offer, clear, definite, and intended to be binding. And herein lies one of the most \nchallenging puzzles of contract law: how does one differentiate a genuine offer from an \ninvitation to treat? \n \nThe answer to this question is not always obvious. The world of commerce is filled with \npromotional messages, advertisements, circulars, shop displays, and catalogues. A seller may \nadvertise a product for sale, but is that advertisement a legal offer that can bind them upon \nacceptance? Or is it merely an invitation to negotiate or a call to customers to make an offer \nthemselves? \n \n \nThe distinction between an offer and an invitation to treat is foundational to determining when a \ncontract has been validly formed. It governs who is legally bound, and when. This seemingly \ntechnical line can carry weighty real-life consequences. For instance, a retailer’s advertisement \nmight entice thousands, but without the intention to be legally bound, it remains a non-binding \ninvitation. Yet, if phrased too definitively, the same ad could trigger a deluge of enforceable \nclaims, like in the case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. \n \nThis essay will explore, with the aid of judicial authority and case law, the precise meaning and \nrequirements of a valid offer, juxtaposed with the nature of an invitation to treat, extensively \ndelineating the distinction between the concepts. Using cases such as Carlill v Carbolic Smoke \nBall Co., Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc, Partridge v Crittenden, and \nFisher v Bell, it will dissect how courts draw the line and why that line must be drawn. It will \nalso examine the commercial logic and public policy underlying the distinction, and discuss the \nlegal consequences when that line becomes blurred. \n \nUltimately, understanding this distinction is not only essential for mastering the law of contract \nbut also for appreciating how the law mediates the balance between freedom of commerce and \nlegal certainty in a marketplace driven by expression, persuasion, and negotiation. \n  \nDEFINITION OF OFFER IN CONTRACT LAW \nAn offer in contract law is a clear expression of willingness by one party (the offeror) to be \nbound by specific terms, made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is \naccepted by the other party (the offeree). The offer must be communicated clearly and must \ncontain definite terms capable of forming a contract once accepted. \n \nAccording to Treitel on the Law of Contract, an offer is “an expression of willingness to \ncontract on certain terms, made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is \naccepted by the person to whom it is addressed. This distinguishes an offer from a mere \ninvitation to treat, which only invites others to make offers.” \n \nThe leading case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256 illustrates the principles \nunderpinning an offer. In this case, the defendants advertised that they would pay £100 to anyone \nwho contracted influenza after using their smoke ball product as instructed. The plaintiff, Mrs. \nCarlill, used the product and still caught influenza. The company argued that the advertisement \nwas not a binding offer, but the court held otherwise. The court found that the advertisement \nconstituted a unilateral offer to the world at large, and that Mrs. Carlill had accepted the offer by \nperforming the conditions specified. This case demonstrates that an offer can be made to the \ngeneral public and that performance of the specified act constitutes acceptance. \n \n \nAnother illustrative case is Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store (1957) 86 NW 2d \n689, a decision from the United States. The store advertised a sale of fur coats for $1 each to the \nfirst customers in line. Mr. Lefkowitz arrived early and offered to buy the coat, but the store \nrefused to sell to him, arguing that the ad was \"just an invitation to treat.\" The court ruled that the \nadvertisement was a clear, definite, and explicit offer, leaving nothing open for negotiation. \nBecause Lefkowitz complied with the terms by being first in line, his acceptance created a \nbinding contract. This case reinforces the idea that when an advertisement contains clear and \ndefinite terms and shows an intention to be bound, it can amount to a valid offer.  \n \nIn sum, for a statement to amount to an offer in contract law, it must: \n1)​ Be clear, definite, and complete in its terms; \n2)​ Be communicated to the offeree; \n3)​ Show an intention to be bound upon acceptance; \nThese requirements ensure clarity and certainty in the formation of legally binding  agreements \n​\nINVITATION TO TREAT \nAn invitation to treat is a statement or action indicating readiness to negotiate but not a legal \noffer. It is not an offer; it is inviting others to make one, which can be accepted or rejected. As \nProf. Ewan McKendrick puts it in Contract Law: Text, Cases, and Materials, an invitation to treat \nis a \"pre-offer communication\" with no intention of being bound upon acceptance. \n \nLegally speaking, while an offer indicates a willingness to be bound lawfully upon acceptance, \nan invitation to treat does not. This distinction ensures that parties are not inadvertently binding \nthemselves into obligations before negotiations have been finalized. \n \nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVITATION TO TREAT AND \nOFFER \n \nThe main difference between an offer and an invitation to treat is legal effect and intent. An \noffer is a promise made with the intention of being bound by an acceptance, but an invitation to \ntreat expresses merely a willingness to accept offers or to negotiate, but not to enter immediately \ninto a contract. \n \n \n \nOffers, if accepted, result in a binding contract. Invitations to treat, however, cannot be accepted \nin order to form a contract, as they do not constitute an irrevocable promise. In Treitel (Law of \nContract, 14th ed.), \"An offer is a definite promise to be bound provided certain specified \nterms are accepted. An invitation to treat is a preliminary step in negotiations.\" \nThis is necessary to prevent putting firms or parties into contract by words of interest never \nintended to be an offer. Common examples of invitations to treat include shop windows, press \nadvertisements, and auction notices. The offer arises where a customer is willing to purchase or \nagree, and the acceptance where the seller agrees. \n \nTESTS FOR INVITATIONS TO TREAT (WITH CASE LAW) \n \nThe case of Storer v Manchester City Council [1974] 1 WLR 1403 outlines that an offer is: “An \nexpression of willingness to contract on specified terms with the intention that it is to be \nbinding once accepted” Storer v Manchester City Council confirmed that in assessing whether \nthese conditions have been met, the courts will take an objective approach. Therefore, the courts \nwill consider how the conduct of the offeror would appear to an objective party, which requires \nan application of the ‘reasonable man’ standard. Therefore, the question to ask is: \n‘On examination of the offeror’s conduct as a whole, would the reasonable person consider \nthe offeror to have expressed a willingness to contract on specified terms with the intention \nthat it is to be binding once accepted?’ \nThis test means there is no consideration of the intentions of the offeror or their state of mind. \nEven if the offeror did not intend his conduct to amount to an offer at all, the courts may still find \ncontractual intent based on this test. This is an interesting standard to apply, as most other civil \nlaws apply a subjective test. \nThe courts have admitted that the ‘reasonable man’ standard is inherently difficult to apply, as it \nis always difficult to be completely impartial or reasonable. However, owing to the lack of a \nbetter alternative, the courts will apply the ‘reasonable man’ standard, if this standard did not \napply, there would be a high amount of absurd rulings and decisions, as will become clearer on \nconsideration of some of the rules of contract law. \nIt is also important to note that the offer must be communicated to the offeree (Taylor v Laird \n(1856) 25 LJ Ex 329) \n \n \nThe case of Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] 1 WLR 294, held the following words to \nbe an invitation to treat: \n“May be prepared to sell the house to you” \nThere was clearly no display of contractual intent, due to the words “may be prepared”, which \nsuggest the Council were open to negotiation, and therefore the statement was construed as an \ninvitation to treat, rather than an offer. Applying the standard from Storer v Manchester City \nCouncil and the ‘reasonable man’ standard, would the reasonable man consider the words “may \nbe prepared to sell the house to you” as being an unequivocal display of contractual intent? \n \nThroughout the history of contract law, there have been various disputes over the distinction \nbetween an offer and an invitation to treat. Therefore, in order to provide consistency, there are a \nnumber of presumptions which are applied to certain types of conduct: \n \nPresumption one - Display of goods \nThe case of Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists [1953] 1 QB 401 \nconfirms that a display of goods is considered to be an invitation to treat. The specific approach \ntaken is as follows: \nThe display of goods in a shop/self-service shop are an invitation to treat, the customer makes \nthe offer to the cashier by presenting the goods at the service desk, the cashier accepts the offer \nby scanning the goods and requesting payment \nReasons why a display of goods is an invitation to treat: There are a multitude of reasons for \nwhich the court construed the display of goods in this way. It is evident that there would be \nvarious issues with the display of goods constituting an offer. If a display of goods was an offer, \nthe acceptance would occur when the customer removes the goods from the shelves. The type of \nproblems that may occur are: \n1)​ The shopkeeper has no choice whether or not to sell to somebody once they have \nremoved an item from the shelves, preventing the shopkeeper’s ability to choose their \ncustomers \n2)​ The acceptance has occurred at the price specified for the goods, meaning there can be no \nnegotiation between the buyer and seller. This is not particularly relevant in most shops \n \nwhere negotiation is not possible, but it is still a relevant issue in some cases, and \nparticularly if an item is mispriced \n3)​ A customer couldn’t choose to exchange the item for another once they have removed it \nfrom the shelf, or replace the item, as acceptance has already occurred. Otherwise, they \nwould be in breach of contract \n \nPresumption two - Display of goods in a shop window \nThe case of Fisher v Bell [1961] QB 394 is the legal precedent that confirms the display of \ngoods in a shop window is an invitation to treat. In this case, the defendant had a knife in the \nwindow of their shop with a price tag attached, which was held to be an invitation to treat. \nReasons why a display of goods in a shop window is an invitation to treat: This presumption \nis based upon the rules from the above case of Pharmaceutical Society v Boots Cash Chemists, \nin that if it was considered an offer, the shopkeeper could not pick and choose his customers. \nThere is a further consideration for display of goods in a shop window; the shop may have a \nlimited stock of the item, therefore if two individuals saw the ‘offer’ at the same time and there \nwas only one available item, the shopkeeper would be in breach of contract to one of the \nindividuals. \n  \nPresumption three - Advertisements \nAs a general rule, the case of Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 2 All ER 421 rules that an \nadvertisement is an invitation to treat. The primary reason for this is the “multi-acceptance” \nprinciple. \n  \nThe multi-acceptance principle: If an advertisement is considered an offer, theoretically, an \nunlimited number of people could accept that offer, which causes obvious problems when the \nadvertisement is for a limited amount of goods, as the seller would be in breach of contract to \neach individual whom they could not provide goods for. \n  \nThis statement from Lord Herschell in the case of Grainger & Son v Gough [1896] AC 325 HL \nsuccinctly describes this issue: \n  \n \n“The transmission of such a price-list does not amount to an offer to supply an unlimited \nquantity of the wine described at the price named, so that as soon as an order is given there is \na binding contract to supply that quantity. If it were so, the merchant might find himself \ninvolved in any number of contractual obligations to supply wine of a particular description \nwhich he would be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of that description being \nnecessarily limited.” \n \nTheory behind the multi-acceptance principle: Following this consideration, it is obvious that \nan advertisement does not fulfil the requirement from Storer v Manchester City Council, as \nthere is clearly no unequivocal display of contractual intent; the reasonable person would \nrecognise that the individual who placed the advertisement never intended to contract with \neverybody who responds to the advert. \n  \nExceptions to advertisements as invitations to treat: \n  \nAdvertisements from a manufacturer \nThere is a theoretical argument that suggests if an advertisement is from a manufacturer it may \nbe construed as an offer. This viewpoint was suggested by Lord Parker in Partridge v \nCrittenden, where he stated that: \n“I think when one is dealing with advertisements and circulars, unless they indeed come from \nmanufacturers, there is business sense in their being construed as invitations to treat and not \noffers for sale” \nAs can be identified, the issue was only mentioned in passing, and there was no debate or \ndiscussion with the other judges. The issue has not been revisited by the courts, therefore, this is \nnot an established legal precedent and should only be treated as a persuasive factor for the courts \nrather than a rule. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnilateral contracts \n  \nBefore the effect of a unilateral contract on an advertisement is considered, a clear definition of a \nunilateral contract is required. \nA unilateral contract is formed where the offeror makes a promise in exchange for an act by any \nofferee. This is often considered to be a contract with the whole world, as theoretically, any \nofferee may accept the contract. Acceptance is made through the performance of the act specified \nin the offer, and the offeree need not communicate his intention to accept/perform. Here is a \ncommon example of a unilateral contract: \n  \nParty A puts a poster up in the street, offering a £100 reward to anybody who finds their lost dog. \nIt is clear that the acceptor of the offer, party B, is any individual who finds the dog, with \nacceptance occurring on performance. The contract is considered to be ‘unilateral’ as there is \nonly obligations for one of the parties; the offeror has the strict obligation to pay the £100 to \nanybody who finds the dog, but there is no second party who must search for the dog, they may \nchoose to, but there is no obligation. \n  \nAdvertisements negating the ‘multi-acceptance’ problem \n  \nThe American case of Lefkowitz v Great Minneapolis Surplus Stores Inc(1957) 86 NW 2d 689, \nalthough only persuasive on the English courts, is an excellent example of the negation of the \n‘multi-acceptance’ problem posed by advertisements. \n  \nThe advertisement stated ‘Saturday 9AM sharp, 3 brand new fur coats worth $100, first come \nfirst served, £1 each’. Multi-acceptance is not an issue here, as it is clear that there are only 3 of \nthe coats available, and only the first three people to arrive at the shop would be able to accept \nthe offer. If the principle from Storer v Manchester City Council is applied, it is objectively \nclear that there is an intention to create legal relations with those first three people. \n  \nIn effect, this example can be seen as a unilateral contract, with the performance required being \nthe arrival at the store first. \n \n \nPresumption four - Tenders \nA tender is where an individual seeks specific goods or services and advertises their need for \nthem. This is construed as an invitation to treat, and any response to the tender will be an offer. \nHere is an example of a tender: \n “I am looking to purchase a new car for around £5,000” \nThere is clearly no contractual intent, as it is merely inviting an offer in response. Even if the \nprice was specified as exactly £5,000, there is still no offer owing to the lack of contractual \nintent, the writer of the tender obviously intends to negotiate and consider his options. \n  \nExceptions \n  \nIntention \nIf a person seeking a tender shows unequivocal intention to be bound, a tender can be construed \nas an offer.In the case of Harvela Investments v Royal Trust Co of Canada [1986] AC 207, the \ndefendants set out a tender for their sale of shares in a company. One of the details in the tender \nwas that they would accept the highest offer. Again, it can be seen that this tender negates the \nissue of multi-acceptance, as the seller can only accept one bid, the highest one. Therefore, the \nhighest bid was considered to be an acceptance of the offer. \n  \nTenders with collateral offers \nIn Blackpool and Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool BC [1990] 1 WLR 1195 the council \nstipulated it would consider all tenders submitted before a specific date. The claimants delivered \ntheir tender before the required date, but the post wasn’t emptied by the defendant. As the \ndefendant did not consider the claimant’s tender, the defendant had breached the collateral \ncontract to consider all tenders submitted before the required date. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nPresumption five - Automated machines \n \nAutomated machines posed an interesting question for the court in Thornton v Shoe Lane \nParking [1971] 2 QB 163. The court ruled that the operation of an automatic machine is \nconsidered an offer. The reasoning behind this was mainly based on the inability of the machine \nto negotiate with the customer and they cannot reject a customer.An interesting debate can be \nhad about exactly when acceptance occurs. It may be contended that the acceptance is made once \nan individual inserts the coins and chooses an option. Acceptance is not at the point of the \ninsertion of coins because the customer can still choose to cancel and get their coins returned. \nHowever, if there is no coin return option, acceptance would likely be held to be on insertion of \npayment. \n  \nPresumption six - Auctions \nAuction without reserve: Where an auction is “without reserve” (i.e there is no minimum priced \nbid required to win the auction) each bid is an offer, and when the auctioneer ends the bidding, \nthis is the acceptance. Therefore, each bidder may revoke their offer at any time before the end of \nthe bidding.The auctioneer could, in theory, refuse to accept the offer, however, in the case of \nauctions, there is a collateral contract, this is between the auctioneer and the highest bidder, \nwhich involves the obligation to accept the highest bidder, meaning any refusal of a highest bid \nwould amount to a breach of contract (Barry v Davies [2000] 1 WLR 1962). \n  \nDamages for a breach of collateral contract: The court will consider the position the bidder \nwould have been in if his bid was accepted. For example, if the auctioneer declined a highest bid \nof £10 for an item worth £100, the price difference between the bid and the market price of the \nitem would be awarded - in this case, £90. \n  \nAuction with reserve: Where an auction is “with reserve”, (i.e the owner of the goods has set a \nminimum price) the auctioneer is only obliged to accept any bids which are above the minimum \nprice. \n  \n \nAdvertisement of an auction: An advertisement of an auction is considered to be an invitation \nto treat, meaning an individual who intends to bid on items cannot bring an action against the \nauctioneer who does not auction the item. In the case of Harris v Nickerson(1872) LR 8 QB the \nclaimant attempted to claim for travel expenses and the time spent travelling for the auction.  \n \nPresumption seven - Online Transactions  \n \nOnline transactions operate on a similar basis to that of advertisements and displays of goods. \nThey are considered to be an invitation to treat, as the customer has the freedom to pick and \nchoose the items in their virtual ‘basket’ before actually committing to a purchase. The question \nof where acceptance occurs is a difficult one with online transactions. The three common points \nof acceptance are on acceptance of the terms & conditions, on payment, or on shipping of the \ngoods. Usually, the terms & conditions of the purchase will stipulate exactly when the binding \ncontract is formed. The most common position for online terms & conditions to take is where \nacceptance occurs on the shipping of the goods. This may seem difficult to reconcile. \n \n \nThe doctrine of invitation to treat is essential in contract law because it protects individuals and \nbusinesses from being legally bound by interest expressions. A contract can only be valid when a \nclear offer has been accepted. As confirmed in the case laws, courts always distinguish between \ninvitations to treat and offers on the bases of intent and legal consequences. \n \nBoth offer and invitation to treat have confusing similarities, thus we shall discuss their \ndifferences in the table below. \n  \n \n  \nOFFER \nINVITATION TO TREAT \nIt is a definite promise or proposal made by a \nparty (an offeror) to the other (the offeree) \nwith the intention to be legally bound to the \nterms of the agreement \nIt merely involves the willingness by a party \nto negotiate or receive an offer from another \nparty. \n \nIt is a clear and unambiguous statement or \nproposal showing definite terms to the \ncontract and the willingness to be legally \nbound. \nInvitation to treat shows no commitment to be \nlegally bound. \nOnce accepted, a legally binding contract is \nformed and the terms must be adhered to even \nif it doesn't suit them. \nAny party can choose to back out or reject the \noffer made if it doesn't suit them. \nAn \noffer \nneeds \nelements \nsuch \nas \nConsideration and acceptance for there to be a \ncontract formed. \nThe only element needed for there to be an \noffer is willingness to negotiate. \nAn offer clearly shows intention to be legally \nbound if accepted, by stating its terms \ntherefore, the offeror doesn't have a right to \ncall off the proposal once accepted. \nThe party inviting shows no readiness to be \nbound legally thus, it gives them the right to \nreject the offer made to them and even call off \nthe invitation to treat. \n \n \n \nThe Relevance of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co: Unilateral \nContract Formation \n   \nCarlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256 stands as one of the most significant \nand enduring cases in English contract law, establishing fundamental principles that continue to \nshape modern contractual jurisprudence. The case represents a watershed moment in the \nunderstanding of unilateral contracts, the distinction between offers and invitations to treat, and \nthe nature of contractual acceptance through performance. \n  \nBackground and Facts of Carlill \n  \nThe Carbolic Smoke Ball Company advertised their product with a bold promise: £100 would be \npaid to anyone who contracted influenza after using their smoke ball according to instructions for \ntwo weeks. To demonstrate their confidence, they deposited £1,000 with their bankers as a \nguarantee of their sincerity. Mrs. Carlill purchased and used the smoke ball as directed but \nsubsequently contracted influenza. When the company refused to pay the promised £100, she \nsued for breach of contract. \n  \nValid Offer versus Invitation to Treat \n \n  \nThe Court of Appeal's determination that the advertisement constituted a valid offer, rather than \nan invitation to treat, established crucial precedent for distinguishing between these concepts. \nThe court identified several key factors that elevated the advertisement beyond a mere invitation \nto treat. \n  \nFirst, the specificity and precision of the terms demonstrated genuine contractual intention. \nUnlike vague promotional statements such as \"satisfaction guaranteed,\" the Carbolic Smoke Ball \nCompany's advertisement contained precise conditions: use for two weeks, follow instructions \nexactly, and receive £100 if influenza was contracted. This specificity indicated an intention to \ncreate legal relations rather than engage in mere commercial puffery. \n  \nSecond, the deposit of £1,000 with bankers provided tangible evidence of the company's serious \nintent. Lord Justice Lindley emphasized that this deposit demonstrated the company's readiness \nto pay and distinguished the advertisement from typical marketing hyperbole. This principle has \nbeen consistently applied in subsequent cases, including Williams v Carwardine [1833] 5 C & P \n566, where the court examined the genuineness of advertised rewards. \n  \nThe court also established that advertisements can constitute offers when they are sufficiently \ncertain and demonstrate clear intention to be bound. This principle contrasts with the general rule \nestablished in cases like Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 1 WLR 1204, where advertisements are \ntypically considered invitations to treat. However, Carlill carved out an important exception for \nunilateral contracts where performance itself constitutes acceptance. \n  \nThe Unilateral Nature of the Contract \n  \nThe unilateral character of the Carlill contract represents perhaps the case's most significant \ncontribution to contract law. Unlike bilateral contracts where promises are exchanged, unilateral \ncontracts involve a promise in exchange for performance. The company's advertisement \nconstituted a promise that could only be accepted through complete performance of the specified \nconditions. \n  \nLord Justice Bowen's judgment clearly articulated this principle, explaining that the offer was \nmade to the world at large and could be accepted by anyone who performed the required \nconditions. The acceptance occurred not through communication but through Mrs. Carlill's \ncomplete performance of using the smoke ball as directed for two weeks while subsequently \ncontracting influenza. \n  \nThis unilateral structure addressed the practical impossibility of requiring prior communication \nof acceptance. As the court noted, it would be absurd to require every potential user to notify the \ncompany of their intention to accept the offer before commencing use of the product. The \n \nperformance itself constituted both acceptance and consideration, creating a complete contract \nupon fulfillment of the conditions. \n  \nThe principle established in Carlill has been consistently applied in reward cases, including R v \nClarke [1927] 40 CLR 227, where the Australian High Court examined similar issues of \nunilateral contract formation through performance. \n  \nModern Relevance and Applications \n  \nThe Carlill decision remains highly relevant in contemporary contract law, particularly in the \ndigital age where online advertisements and promotional offers proliferate. The case provides \nessential guidance for determining when promotional materials constitute binding offers rather \nthan mere marketing statements. \n  \nModern applications include loyalty programs, promotional competitions, and warranty \npromises. Courts continue to apply Carlill's principles when evaluating whether commercial \nadvertisements create enforceable obligations. The case's emphasis on specificity, genuine \nintention, and tangible evidence of commitment remains the benchmark for distinguishing \nbetween offers and invitations to treat. \n  \nThe unilateral contract principles established in Carlill also remain vital for understanding \nreward scenarios, insurance contracts, and performance-based agreements. The case's recognition \nthat acceptance can occur through performance rather than communication continues to facilitate \npractical commercial arrangements where bilateral communication is impractical or impossible. \n  \nFurthermore, Carlill's influence extends to consumer protection law, where the case's emphasis \non genuine commercial intention helps distinguish between enforceable promises and misleading \nadvertising. The decision supports consumer rights by holding businesses accountable for \nspecific promises made in their promotional materials, provided these promises meet the Carlill \ncriteria for valid offers. \n   \nCarlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company remains a cornerstone of contract law, providing \nenduring principles that continue to shape contractual analysis over 130 years after the decision. \nThe case's careful distinction between offers and invitations to treat, based on specificity, \ngenuine intention, and tangible evidence of commitment, provides clear guidance for courts and \npractitioners alike. \n  \nThe recognition of unilateral contracts as distinct contractual arrangements, where acceptance \noccurs through performance rather than communication, has proven invaluable in addressing the \npractical realities of commercial relationships. As commerce continues to evolve, particularly in \n \ndigital environments, the fundamental principles established in Carlill provide a robust \nframework for understanding when promotional statements create enforceable legal obligations. \n  \nThe case's lasting relevance demonstrates the wisdom of the Court of Appeal's analysis and the \nuniversal applicability of its core principles to diverse contractual scenarios across different eras \nand commercial contexts. \n  \n \nREASONS FOR THE BLURRY LINES BETWEEN OFFER AND \nINVITATION TO TREAT \n \nThe line between an offer and an invitation to treat can be blurry because of the nuances in \nintention, language, and context. Here's a breakdown of the main reasons why this line is often \nnot clear; \n \nAmbiguity in Language Used \nThe words used in advertisements, notices, or negotiations are often vague or open to \ninterpretation. For example, a statement like “I am willing to sell my car for ₦5 million” might \nsound like an offer, but it could just be a declaration of willingness to negotiate an invitation to \ntreat. \n \nContext of the Statement \nThe context in which a statement is made matters. In shops, catalogues, or online listings, goods \nwith a price tag look like offers, but courts often treat them as invitations to treat. \nExample: Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists  displaying goods on \nshelves was held to be an invitation to treat, not an offer. \n \nCommercial Practice and Policy \nCourts often distinguish between offer and invitation based on commercial convenience. If every \ndisplayed good were an offer, sellers could be bound to sell to everyone, which would be \nimpractical. Hence, policy reasons support treating shop displays and ads as invitations, not \noffers. \n \nMisleading Advertisements or Tenders \nSome ads seem specific and definite (e.g. “First come, first served”), which can mislead buyers \ninto thinking an offer is being made. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., the court treated an \nad as a valid offer because it was specific and included a deposit of money to show seriousness. \n \n \nTendering Process \nCalling for tenders is generally an invitation to treat, while the actual tender submitted is the \noffer. But if the request for tenders includes a promise to accept the highest/lowest bid, it might \namount to a binding offer (see Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust Co of Canada) \n  \n \n \n \nCRITICISMS & GRAY AREAS OF INVITATION TO TREAT \n \nCommercial Manipulation - Using Invitation to Treat to Escape Liability \nStrategy: Businesses deliberately frame statements (e.g., ads, pricing) as “invitations to treat” so \nthey aren’t legally bound at that point letting them withdraw, add conditions, or refuse later. \nExample: Argos website mispricing incident in 2013 because listings were treated as invitations \nto treat, Argos didn’t have to honor the mistaken low price. In E-commerce, dynamic pricing and \nautomated listings rely on this doctrine to preserve flexibility   \n \nConsumer Protection Concerns \nRisk: Misleading wording such as bait‑and‑switch ads can deceive vulnerable consumers, \nleaving them without legal remedy if businesses claim it was only an invitation to treat. \nRegulation: Many jurisdictions enforce clear‑info rules; false/misleading invitations violate \nconsumer protection laws like FTC rules in the US, and similar provisions elsewhere. Deceptive \ninvitations undermine market trust and disproportionately harm non‑expert consumers. \n \nContract Fairness \nUnconscionability: Contracts formed via manipulative invitations may be voided if terms are \noverly one‑sided or hidden in fine print. \nUnfair Clauses: Under acts like UCTA 1977, businesses cannot rely on exclusion clauses tucked \ninto invitations after a customer has committed. \nConsumer Law: Many legal systems (e.g., South Africa’s CPA) require conspicuous disclosure \nand ban unfair practices, giving clients rights against oppressive or deceptive contractual terms. \n \n  \nJudicial Inconsistencies \n1. Discretionary Interpretation \nCourts often interpret cases based on the specific language and context, leading to inconsistent \noutcomes. What one court sees as a mere invitation, another might treat as a binding offer, \nespecially in advertisements and tender cases. \n2. Fine Distinctions Lead to Unpredictability \nTiny wording differences (e.g., “may be prepared to sell” vs “I will sell”) can change legal \noutcomes, making case law unpredictable. \nThis makes it difficult for businesses and consumers to know their rights without legal advice. \n  \nJustification for the Distinction \n 1. Practicality in Commerce \nTreating displays and ads as invitations to treat prevents chaos; sellers can run out of stock or \nreject certain buyers. If every display were an offer, sellers would be bound to every customer, \nwhich isn’t feasible. \n 2. Protection for Sellers \nIt gives sellers the right to refuse sales (e.g., due to age restrictions, legal limits, or errors like \nmispricing). \n 3. Maintains Freedom of Contract \nPrevents involuntary contracts; parties are only bound when clear acceptance of a specific offer \noccurs. \n 4. Encourages Negotiation \nAllows space for bargaining, counter-offers, and flexibility in commercial relationships. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nIn sum, the distinction between an offer and an invitation to treat lies at the very heart of \ncontractual certainty and enforceability. While an offer reflects a definite willingness to be bound \nupon acceptance, an invitation to treat merely opens the door to negotiation without immediate \nlegal consequences. As shown through leading cases like Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., \n \nPartridge v Crittenden, and Pharmaceutical Society v Boots, courts have consistently upheld \nthis separation to protect both commercial freedom and contractual integrity. \nUnderstanding this distinction does more than satisfy academic curiosity, it determines when a \nlegal obligation arises, who bears liability, and how businesses and consumers navigate daily \ntransactions. Mistaking an invitation to treat an offer could lead to premature enforcement of \ncontracts, unfair obligations, or legal disputes. \nThus, the principle laid down by Bowen LJ remains timeless: while an offer may echo across \nthe world, only those who respond in the prescribed manner form the legal bond that \ncontract law protects. Recognizing where negotiation ends and obligation begins is not just \ndoctrinal, it is essential to justice in commerce. \n \n \nReferences: \n1. Treitel, G.H.

Chukwuemeka, a 10 year old boy bought a 20 carat gold \nchain wrist watch worth ₦5million from Alhaji Aminu. \n \nb. Mr. Digbolugi, a well-known lunatic bought a ₦200 roasted \ncorn and ₦100 worth ofbottled water from Mama Dogood \nclaiming he was hungry. \n \nc.

Alhaji Gudugudu who could neither read, write nor \nunderstand English language entered into a contract for a \nlease of his 5 acres of land at Ajibode Area of Ibadan to John \nSmith for a period of 10 years in the sum of ₦10 million, only \nfor John Smith to produce a document ofthe transaction duly \nthumb printed by Alhaji Gudugudu which was titled, Land \nSale Agreement.. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na. ChukwuemSeka, a 10-year-old boy bought a 20-carat gold chain \nwristwatch worth ₦5 million from Alhaji Aminu. \nIssue: \nThe central and most critical legal issue presented by this scenario is whether a \ncontract for the purchase of a luxury item, specifically a 20-carat gold chain \nwristwatch valued at an exorbitant ₦5 million, entered into by Chukwuemeka, \na 10-year-old boy, possesses legal validity and enforceability under the \nprevailing contract law. \n \nAnalysis \nThe fundamental rule stipulates that an individual attains full and unrestricted \ncontractual capacity only upon reaching the age of majority, which is uniformly \nestablished at 21 years in Nigeria. This age threshold has been consistently \napplied in Nigerian courts by distinguishing adults from those who require legal \nprotection in contractual dealings. Consequently, any person who has not yet \nreached this stipulated age is legally classified as a minor for all contractual \npurposes and, as such, possesses only a limited and circumscribed capacity to \nenter into binding agreements. Contracts involving minors are generally \ncategorized into three distinct classes, each carrying different legal \nimplications. Firstly, there are void contracts, which are considered null and \nwithout legal effect from their very inception, as if they never existed. Under \nthe strictures of the Infants Relief Act 1874, certain types of contracts with \nminors are explicitly rendered absolutely void; these notably include contracts \nfor goods other than necessaries, agreements for money lent, and accounts \nstated. The implication of a contract being void is that it creates no legal rights \nor obligations for either party, and neither can seek to enforce it. Secondly, \nthere are voidable contracts, which, unlike void contracts, are initially valid and \nenforceable but can be repudiated (rejected or set aside) by the minor, \ntypically upon reaching the age of majority or within a reasonable period \nthereafter. This category often encompasses contracts relating to land, shares, \nor partnership agreements, granting the minor the crucial option to either \naffirm (ratify) or repudiate the agreement. Thirdly, there are valid contracts, \nwhich, despite the minor's age, are fully binding on them. The most significant \nand frequently invoked exception within this category is contracts for \n\"necessaries\" and, to a lesser extent, beneficial contracts of service. The \ncourts, as seen in Adegbite v. Lawal (2009) 1 NWLR (Pt. 1121) 1, consistently \nuphold the protective stance towards minors, emphasizing that their \ncontractual obligations are limited. \nThe concept of \"necessaries\" forms the cornerstone of the exception that \nallows certain contracts with minors to be binding. Section 3 of the Sale of \nGoods Act 1893 stipulates that a minor is indeed liable to pay a reasonable \nprice for necessaries that have been sold and delivered to them. The definition \nof \"necessaries\" is not rigidly confined to the bare essentials required for \nsurvival, such as food, clothing, and shelter. Instead, it possesses a degree of \nflexibility, extending to goods and services that are deemed suitable to the \nminor's particular condition in life and are genuinely required by them at the \nprecise time of sale and delivery. This nuanced definition necessitates a \nconsideration of the minor's social status, their wealth, and their specific, \nactual needs. For example, while a basic meal is always a necessary, a bespoke \nsuit might be considered a necessary for a wealthy minor attending a formal \nsocial event, whereas it would clearly not be for a minor from a less affluent \nbackground. The is found in the case of Peters v. Fleming (1840) 6 M & W 42. \nIn this case, the court held that these items could potentially qualify as \nnecessaries, depending on the minor's social standing. This judgment helped in \nestablishing that the concept of necessaries extends beyond mere articles of \nbare subsistence to include items that are appropriate to the minor's \ncircumstances, provided they are actually needed. The case of Labinjoh v. \nAbake (1924) 5 NLR 33 further clarifies the stringent test for necessaries, \nemphasizing that the goods must be suitable to the minor's actual \nrequirements at the time of delivery, not merely suitable to their station in life. \nCritically, the burden of proving that the goods supplied are indeed \nnecessaries, encompassing both their suitability to the minor's condition in life \nand their actual requirement by the minor at the time of the transaction (i.e., \nensuring the minor was not already adequately supplied with such goods), \nrests squarely and entirely with the seller. \nFurthermore, while the general unenforceability of minors' contracts is a \nprotective shield, the doctrine of restitution may, in specific and limited \ncircumstances, offer a remedy. If a minor has obtained goods through \nfraudulent means (for instance, by falsely misrepresenting their age) and still \nretains possession of these identifiable goods in their original form, a court of \nequity might, in its discretion, compel the minor to restore the goods to the \nseller. However, it is imperative to note that courts are generally hesitant and \nreluctant to order such restitution if doing so would effectively amount to an \nindirect enforcement of a contract that is otherwise void or voidable, or if the \ngoods have been consumed, dissipated, or are no longer identifiable. This \njudicial reluctance is underscored by the authoritative case of Leslie v. Sheill \n(1914) 3 KB 607. In this landmark decision, a minor had fraudulently \nmisrepresented his age to secure a loan. The court unequivocally held that \nwhile the loan contract itself was void, the money lent could not be recovered \nby an action for restitution because such a recovery would constitute an \nindirect enforcement of a void contract. The court emphatically clarified that \nthe doctrine of restitution applies only when the specific goods obtained by \nfraud remain identifiable and are still in the minor's actual possession. \nMoreover, Leslie v. Sheill firmly established that a minor's misrepresentation of \ntheir age, even if fraudulent, does not operate as an estoppel to prevent them \nfrom invoking or pleading infancy as a valid defense to avoid the enforcement \nof a contract. This means that even if Chukwuemeka had deceived Alhaji \nAminu about his age, he would still be legally entitled to disclaim the contract \ndue to his minority. The case of Jennings v. Rundall (1799) also supports the \nnotion that a minor cannot be sued in tort for something arising directly from a \nvoid contract, reinforcing the protective stance. \nApplying these well-established legal principles to the specific facts of \nChukwuemeka's case, several critical points emerge with striking clarity. Firstly, \nChukwuemeka, at the tender age of 10 years, falls significantly below the \nstatutory age of majority (21 years) in Nigeria. Therefore, he is legally and \nunequivocally classified as a minor, possessing only a limited and restricted \ncontractual capacity. This fact immediately places the transaction under the \nprotective scrutiny of the law concerning minors, as highlighted by the general \nprinciples of contractual capacity for infants. \nSecondly, the subject matter of the contract, a 20-carat gold chain wristwatch \nvalued at an exorbitant ₦5 million, cannot, under any reasonable or legal \ninterpretation, be categorized as a \"necessary\" for a 10-year-old boy. \nRegardless of any potential social standing or wealth that might be attributed \nto him, such an item is inherently a luxury, not an essential good or service \nrequired for his livelihood, education, or welfare. The facts explicitly confirm \nthat \"the item in question is clearly not a necessity for a child of his age,\" \nthereby decisively removing the transaction from the crucial exception for \nnecessaries that would otherwise render it binding on a minor, consistent with \nthe strict interpretation in Labinjoh v. Abake (1924). The immense value of the \nwatch, disproportionate to the needs of a child, further solidifies its \nclassification as a non-necessary. \nThirdly, the provided facts offer no indication whatsoever that Chukwuemeka \nwas accompanied by a parent or legal guardian during the transaction. The \nabsence of such supervision or explicit parental involvement means that there \nis no basis to imply parental consent or subsequent ratification of the \nagreement, which might otherwise have lent some degree of validity to the \ncontract. The transaction appears to have been conducted directly and solely \nbetween the minor and Alhaji Aminu. \nThe Infants Relief Act 1874 categorize this contract as absolutely void, given \nthat it is an agreement for goods other than necessaries. Even under a more \nlenient common law interpretation, the contract would undeniably be voidable \nat Chukwuemeka's option, allowing him to disaffirm it, consistent with the \ngeneral protective stance of Nigerian law as seen in Adegbite v. Lawal (2009). \nIn conclusion, the contract entered into by Chukwuemeka, a 10-year-old \nminor, for the purchase of a ₦5 million luxury wristwatch from Alhaji Aminu is \nlegally unenforceable against Chukwuemeka. The wristwatch, by its very \nnature and exorbitant price, clearly does not qualify as a \"necessary\" item for a \nchild of his age, thereby precluding the application of the primary exception \nthat would typically bind a minor to an agreement. Consequently, the contract \nis either void ab initio under the principles of the Infants Relief Act 1874 or, at \nthe very least, voidable at Chukwuemeka's discretion under common law. \nAlhaji Aminu's potential recourse would be narrowly confined, possibly to \nseeking restitution of the physical watch if it remains intact and identifiable in \nChukwuemeka's possession, though even this remedy is often subject to \njudicial discretion and practical limitations, as highlighted by Leslie v. Sheill \n(1914). \n \n \nb. Mr. Digbolugi, a well-known lunatic bought a ₦200 roasted corn and ₦100 \nworth of bottled water from Mama Dogood claiming he was hungry. \nIssue: \nThe primary legal issue arising from this scenario is whether a contract for the \npurchase of food and water, entered into by Mr. Digbolugi, who is explicitly \nidentified as a \"well-known lunatic,\" is legally valid and enforceable under \nNigerian law, particularly considering his mental incapacity and the specific \nclassification of the goods as \"necessaries.\" \n \nAnalysis: \nThe contractual capacity of persons of unsound mind, frequently referred to as \nlunatics or mentally incapacitated individuals, constitutes a critical and \nprotective facet of contract law designed to shield individuals who, due to their \nmental state, are genuinely unable to make rational and informed decisions \nregarding contractual obligations. The general rule dictates that a contract \nentered into by a person of unsound mind is typically voidable at their \ninstance. However, for such a contract to be rendered voidable, two stringent \nconditions must be concurrently satisfied. Firstly, it must be demonstrably \nproven that the person was, at the precise moment the contract was formed, \nincapable of understanding the fundamental nature and consequences of the \nagreement. Secondly, it must be established that the other party to the \ncontract, in this case, Mama Dogood was either actually aware of the mental \nincapacity or, given the circumstances, ought reasonably to have been aware \nof it. This dual requirement was affirmed in the landmark case of Imperial Loan \nCo. v. Stone, which held that a contract made by a person of unsound mind is \nvoidable only if the other contracting party possessed knowledge of the mental \nincapacity. If the other party had no knowledge of the mental condition and \nthe incapacity was not readily apparent, the contract would generally be \nconsidered valid, unless the incapacity was so patent that it should have been \nobvious to any reasonable observer, as discussed in Onwuchekwa v. Nigerian \nOil Palm Producers Ltd, which emphasizes that the lack of understanding must \nbe known to the other party. \nNevertheless, a crucial and significant exception exists for persons of unsound \nmind, mirroring the exception applied to minors, specifically concerning \ncontracts for \"necessaries.\" This exception is explicitly codified in Section 3 of \nthe Sale of Goods Act 1893. This section unequivocally states that \"where \nnecessaries are sold and delivered to an infant or minor, or to a person who by \nreason of mental incapacity or drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he \nmust pay a reasonable price therefor.\" This statutory provision underscores a \npolicy objective: to ensure that even individuals lacking full contractual \ncapacity due to mental infirmity are legally obligated to pay for essential goods \nthat sustain their life and well-being. The definition of \"necessaries\" in this \ncontext, consistent with its application to minors, is not narrowly confined to \nmere subsistence items. Instead, it encompasses goods that are suitable to the \nperson's condition in life and are genuinely required by them at the time of \nsale and delivery. This typically includes, but is not limited to, fundamental \nitems for survival such as food, drink, shelter, clothing, and essential medical \ncare. The underlying rationale for this vital exception is twofold: it ensures that \nincapacitated individuals can still procure and receive essential items necessary \nfor their survival and daily functioning, while simultaneously protecting the \nlegitimate interests of suppliers who provide these goods in good faith, \npreventing them from suffering losses when providing vital services. While the \ncase of Peters v. Fleming primarily involved a minor, its broader principle, that \nindividuals lacking full contractual capacity may nonetheless be held liable for \nnecessaries supplied to them, provided the goods are suited to their condition \nin life and meet their actual requirements, is equally applicable and persuasive \nin the context of persons of unsound mind. \nIn the specific facts of this scenario, Mr. Digbolugi is explicitly and prominently \nidentified as a \"well-known lunatic.\" This crucial factual detail carries \nsignificant legal weight because it creates a strong presumption that Mama \nDogood, operating within the same community and likely aware of local \nreputations, \"was, or ought to have been, aware of his mental state at the time \nof the transaction.\" This imputed knowledge directly satisfies the second \ncondition required for a contract with a person of unsound mind to be deemed \nvoidable, as per Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone and the principles discussed in \nOnwuchekwa v. Nigerian Oil Palm Producers Ltd. Consequently, if the \ncontract had involved a non-essential item, or if there were any indications of \nexploitation or unconscionable conduct on Mama Dogood's part, the contract \nwould almost certainly be voidable at Mr. Digbolugi's instance, allowing him to \nset it aside. \nHowever, the precise nature of the goods purchased fundamentally and \ndecisively alters the legal outcome. Mr. Digbolugi acquired ₦200 worth of \nroasted corn and ₦100 worth of bottled water, explicitly stating that he was \nhungry. Food (roasted corn) and drink (bottled water) are, without question, \nquintessential examples of \"necessaries\" as defined by law. They are \nabsolutely essential for human sustenance and directly address his immediate, \nexpressed need for nourishment. The combined total cost of ₦300 for these \nbasic items appears entirely reasonable and proportionate to their value, and \nthe provided facts offer no suggestion whatsoever that Mama Dogood \nengaged in any form of exploitation, overcharging, or acted in bad faith. \nTherefore, the transaction falls squarely and unequivocally within the \n\"necessaries\" exception as explicitly stipulated by Section 3 of the Sale of \nGoods Act 1893. This specific statutory exception operates to validate the \ncontract for these essential items, thereby overriding the general rule of \nvoidability that would otherwise apply to contracts with persons of unsound \nmind when it concerns non-essential goods. The law, in this particular instance, \nimposes a clear and binding obligation on Mr. Digbolugi to pay a \"reasonable \nprice\" for these vital necessaries, recognizing the societal need for \nincapacitated individuals to access fundamental goods, a principle reinforced \nby the spirit of Peters v. Fleming (1840). \nIn conclusion, despite Mr. Digbolugi's status as a \"well-known lunatic,\" which \nwould generally render his contracts voidable, the specific transaction for \nroasted corn and bottled water is legally valid and fully enforceable. This is \nbecause the items purchased are unequivocally classified as \"necessaries,\" \nsupplied to meet his immediate and essential needs (hunger and thirst) at a \nreasonable and fair price. Mama Dogood is therefore legally entitled to recover \nthe ₦300 for the goods supplied. This outcome perfectly illustrates the delicate \nbalance that Nigerian law seeks to achieve: it prioritizes the protection of \nvulnerable and incapacitated individuals by generally allowing them to avoid \ncontracts, but it simultaneously ensures that they can still obtain essential \nitems for their survival, while also safeguarding the legitimate interests of \nthose who provide such fundamental goods in good faith, preventing them \nfrom suffering losses when performing a necessary service, a balance evident \nin the application of Section 3 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893. \n \nc. Omuti, a notorious drunkard under the influence of alcohol entered into a \ncontract with Mr. Smart to sell his brand new iPhone 15 Plus for a sum of \n₦1000 which Mr. Smart promptly paid for. \n \nIssue: \nThe core legal issue presented in this complex scenario is the precise validity \nand ultimate enforceability of a contract entered into by Omuti, who is \nexplicitly identified as a \"notorious drunkard,\" while he was undeniably under \nthe profound influence of alcohol. This is particularly critical given that the \nsubject matter of the contract, a brand new iPhone 15 Plus, was sold for a \ngrossly and shockingly undervalued price of merely ₦1000, thereby raising \nserious questions regarding Omuti's impaired contractual capacity and the \nstrong potential for Mr. Smart to have taken undue advantage or engaged in \nunconscionable bargaining. \n \nAnalysis: \nThe legal principles governing the contractual capacity of intoxicated persons \nin Nigeria are, by and large, treated analogously to those applied to persons of \nunsound mind. These principles are rooted in common law traditions and are \nfurther supported by specific statutory provisions, such as Section 28 of the \nNigerian Contract Act (Mercantile Law), which implicitly acknowledges the \ndiminished capacity arising from intoxication. The general rule dictates that a \ncontract entered into by an individual who is so severely intoxicated as to be \ngenuinely incapable of understanding the fundamental nature and \nconsequences of the transaction is voidable at their option. However, for such \na contract to be successfully rendered voidable, two critical conditions must \ntypically be met with sufficient evidence. Firstly, it must be demonstrably \nproven that the person was, at the precise moment the contract was formed, \nso profoundly impaired by alcohol that they could not genuinely comprehend \nthe terms and overall effect of the agreement. Secondly, and equally \nimportant, the other party to the contract, in this instance, Mr. Smart, the \nsober party must have been aware of the intoxication and the resulting \nincapacity of the intoxicated individual. Akinfosile v. Ijose serves as a highly \nrelevant authority in this context, emphasizing the paramount importance of \ngenuine capacity in the formation of any valid contract; in such a scenario, the \ncourt would meticulously scrutinize whether the intoxicated party truly \nunderstood the agreement's implications. If the sober party knowingly \nproceeds with a contract despite being fully aware of the other's intoxication \nand incapacity, it raises profound questions regarding the fairness of the \ntransaction and, crucially, the presence of true and unvitiated consent. \nBeyond the mere state of intoxication, the law extends its protective scrutiny \nto situations where one party exploits another's vulnerability, leading to the \napplication of concepts such as unconscionable bargaining and undue \nadvantage. Unconscionable bargaining occurs when the terms of a contract \nare so fundamentally unfair, oppressive, or one-sided that they \"shock the \nconscience\" of the court. It typically arises from a significant power imbalance \nbetween the contracting parties, where one party actively capitalizes on the \nother's inherent weakness, which could stem from factors such as illiteracy, \nmental infirmity, economic duress, or, as is pertinent here, severe intoxication. \nNigerian courts have consistently and resolutely demonstrated a strong \naversion to exploitative contracts, actively intervening to prevent such \ninjustices. This firm judicial stance is vividly illustrated in cases such as Olowu \nv. Olowu and Osho v. Foreign Finance Corp, which unequivocally demonstrate \nthe judiciary's willingness and capacity to intervene and set aside agreements \nfound to be unconscionable or tainted by undue influence, thereby upholding \nprinciples of fairness and equity. A glaring and disproportionate \nundervaluation of an asset, particularly when coupled with the evident \nvulnerable or impaired state of one of the parties, serves as a compelling and \noften decisive indicator of unconscionability. It is also a critical legal point that \nif an intoxicated person, upon subsequently regaining sobriety, explicitly \naffirms or ratifies the contract—for example, by continuing to act on its terms, \naccepting its benefits, or failing to repudiate it within a reasonable time—they \nmay effectively lose their legal right to later repudiate it. Conversely, a timely \nand unequivocal repudiation upon regaining sobriety would render the \ncontract void. \nIn this specific and troubling scenario, Omuti is explicitly characterized as a \n\"notorious drunkard,\" and it is unequivocally stated that he was \"under the \ninfluence of alcohol\" at the precise moment he entered into the contract. This \nfactual description powerfully suggests that Omuti was, at that time, \nprofoundly impaired and genuinely incapable of understanding the true nature \nand far-reaching consequences of agreeing to sell his \"brand new iPhone 15 \nPlus\" for the remarkably insignificant sum of merely ₦1000. The stipulated \nprice represents an utterly \"ridiculously low price\" and a \"gross \nundervaluation\" for a contemporary, high-value smartphone, which, in itself, \nserves as a potent indicator of Omuti's severely impaired judgment and \ncognitive function at the time of the transaction. \nCrucially, because Omuti is identified as a \"notorious drunkard,\" it is highly \nprobable, and indeed legally inferable, that Mr. Smart \"would reasonably be \naware of his condition.\" This imputed knowledge on Mr. Smart's part directly \nfulfills the second critical condition necessary for the contract to be rendered \nvoidable due to intoxication, consistent with the principles in Akinfosile v. Ijose \n(1960). Mr. Smart's immediate and eager payment for such a grossly \nundervalued item, despite his likely awareness of Omuti's well-known \nreputation for drunkenness, strongly suggests that he may have actively taken \n\"undue advantage\" of Omuti's vulnerable and cognitively impaired state. This \ncourse of conduct by Mr. Smart aligns precisely with the legal concept of \n\"unconscionable bargaining,\" a practice that Nigerian courts are steadfast in \npreventing and will not hesitate to penalize, as evidenced by cases like Olowu \nv. Olowu and Osho v. Foreign Finance Corp. The contract, under these specific \ncircumstances, is not void ab initio (from its very beginning); rather, the \nvitiating factor of intoxication typically renders a contract voidable. This means \nthe agreement is initially valid but remains susceptible to being set aside at \nOmuti's election. The fundamental absence of genuine consent on Omuti's \npart, directly and undeniably attributable to his impaired capacity caused by \nintoxication, stands as the primary vitiating factor in this agreement. \nIn conclusion, the contract entered into between Omuti and Mr. Smart is \nunequivocally voidable at Omuti's discretion. Upon regaining his sobriety and \nfull cognitive function, Omuti possesses the clear legal right to rescind (cancel) \nthe contract. To effectively exercise this right of rescission, he would typically \nbe required to return the ₦1000 he received from Mr. Smart and, in turn, \ndemand the immediate return of his brand new iPhone 15 Plus. Should Mr. \nSmart refuse to comply with this legitimate request, Omuti would have a \nrobust and compelling legal basis to initiate a lawsuit for the recovery of his \nproperty or for damages incurred. The overwhelming evidence of the iPhone's \nsevere undervaluation, coupled with Mr. Smart's highly probable awareness of \nOmuti's notorious state of drunkenness, powerfully supports the argument \nthat the contract was formed under unconscionable circumstances, thereby \ngranting Omuti the undeniable legal right to avoid the agreement and seek \nappropriate redress, consistent with Nigerian courts' stance against \nexploitative contracts. \n \n \n \n \n \nd. Alhaji Gudugudu who could neither read, write nor understand English \nlanguage entered into a contract for a lease of his 5 acres of land at Ajibode \nArea of Ibadan to John Smith for a period of 10 years in the sum of ₦10 \nmillion, only for John Smith to produce a document of the transaction duly \nthumb printed by Alhaji Gudugudu which was titled, Land Sale Agreement. \nIssue: \nThe central and multifaceted legal issues presented in this complex scenario \nare, firstly, whether a contract entered into by an illiterate person can be \nconsidered legally valid and enforceable under Nigerian law when the specific \nstatutory protections meticulously designed for illiterates are demonstrably \nnot observed. Secondly, and equally critically, the issue concerns whether the \nprofound and irreconcilable disparity between Alhaji Gudugudu's clear \nintended agreement (a 10-year lease of his land) and the document \nsubsequently produced and thumb-printed by him (an outright \"Land Sale \nAgreement\") constitutes a fundamental misrepresentation, a vitiating mistake, \nor a complete absence of consensus ad idem, thereby rendering the entire \ncontract legally invalid. \nAnalysis \nThe contractual capacity of illiterates in Nigeria represents a unique and highly \nprotective area of law. This framework meticulously balances the general \npresumption that an individual possesses the capacity to contract with the \nimperative need for specific protective measures, necessitated by the inherent \nvulnerability of illiterate persons in formal legal and commercial transactions. \nThe overarching general rule under Nigerian law is that illiteracy, in and of \nitself, does not automatically disqualify an individual from possessing the legal \ncapacity to enter into a contract. An illiterate adult, like any other person of full \nage and sound mind, is presumed capable of forming a binding legal \nagreement. \nHowever, precisely because of their heightened vulnerability and the \nsignificant potential for exploitation, Nigerian law imposes stringent and \nelevated responsibilities on the party who is dealing with an illiterate \nindividual. The primary legislative instrument governing these contracts is the \nIlliterates Protection Act, Cap I15 LFN 2004 (and analogous laws enacted in \nvarious Nigerian states, which largely mirror its provisions). This Act, in \nconjunction with a substantial body of relevant case law, mandates strict \nrequirements to ensure that the illiterate person genuinely and fully \nunderstands the terms and implications of the agreement they are entering \ninto. These key statutory mandates include: first, that the document must be \nthoroughly read over and explained to the illiterate person in a language they \nfully understand before they affix their signature or thumb-print to it; second, \nthat a specific certificate, commonly referred to as an \"Illiterate Jurat,\" which \nformally confirms that the document was indeed read and explained to the \nilliterate, and that they appeared to understand its contents, must be explicitly \ninserted into the document itself; and third, that the full name and address of \nthe individual who performed the reading and explanation of the document to \nthe illiterate must also be clearly included within the document. The profound \nlegal consequence of failing to comply with these stringent statutory \nprotections is that the contract can be rendered voidable at the instance of the \nilliterate person. In such circumstances, the burden of proof shifts squarely and \nunequivocally to the party relying on the document (i.e., the literate party) to \naffirmatively prove that there was full disclosure and that the illiterate person \ngenuinely understood the contents of the agreement, particularly if the \nilliterate alleges misunderstanding or misrepresentation. This critical principle \nhas been firmly established and consistently re-affirmed in seminal Nigerian \ncases such as Ameh v. Ilesanmi Press Ltd (1986) 1 NWLR (Pt. 19) 751 and \nU.A.C. v. Edems & Ajayi (1958) FSC 1, where the courts have repeatedly set \naside documents executed by illiterates under false or misunderstood terms \ndue to non-compliance with the Act. Furthermore, Osefo v. Uwaifo (1976) 11 \nSC 89 reinforces the absolute necessity for strict adherence to these protective \nrequirements, underscoring their mandatory nature, a stance reiterated in \nU.A.C. (Nig.) Ltd. v. Global Transport S.A. (1996) 5 NWLR (Pt. 448) 291. The \nSupreme Court in Eze v. Okolonji (1997) 7 NWLR (Pt. 511) 118 further clarified \nthe heavy burden on the party relying on the document to prove compliance \nwith the Act. \nBeyond the specific provisions of the Illiterates Protection Act, general contract \nprinciples concerning genuine consent are equally paramount in assessing the \nvalidity of such agreements. A fundamental and indispensable principle of \ncontract law is the requirement of consensus ad idem, which translates to a \ntrue \"meeting of the minds\" between the contracting parties on all essential \nterms of the agreement. If the parties are operating under a fundamental \nmistake regarding the very nature or subject matter of the contract, there is no \ngenuine consent, and consequently, no true agreement. This can lead to a \ncontract being void ab initio. Misrepresentation, which occurs when one party \nmakes a false statement of fact that induces the other party to enter into the \ncontract, can also vitiate consent. If the misrepresentation is fraudulent \n(meaning it was made knowingly, without belief in its truth, or recklessly as to \nits truth), it renders the contract voidable and may also give rise to an \nindependent action in tort for deceit. A fundamental mistake as to the very \nnature of the document being signed, a doctrine known as non est factum (\"it \nis not my deed\"), can render the contract void ab initio due to the complete \nabsence of consent. This occurs when a person signs a document believing it to \nbe fundamentally different from what it actually is, provided their mistake was \nnot due to their own carelessness. These principles are robustly supported by a \nlineage of authoritative cases. For instance, Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd, while a \ncomplex case, broadly discusses how a fundamental mistake can be so \nprofound as to vitiate consent. Smith v. Hughes highlights the critical \nimplications when one party is mistaken about a fundamental term and the \nother party exploits that mistake. Furthermore, Griffith v. Brymer and Scriven \nBros v. Hindley are frequently cited for the unequivocal principle that a clear \nabsence of consensus ad idem on the subject matter of the contract is a \nsufficient ground to invalidate it. \nFinally, the equitable doctrine of unconscionability plays a significant and \noften decisive role in preventing manifest injustice. Where one party actively \nexploits the vulnerability, ignorance, or inherent weakness of another, \nparticularly in situations involving a clear and undeniable power imbalance, \ncourts of equity possess the inherent jurisdiction to intervene and set aside \nsuch \"unconscionable\" transactions. This equitable intervention is powerfully \ndemonstrated in Nigerian jurisprudence through cases like Ajayi v. Texaco \nNigeria Ltd (1987) 3 NWLR (Pt. 62) 577 and Ayoade v. Spring Bank Plc (2013) \n1 NWLR (Pt. 1334) 110. Both judgments unequivocally affirm the Nigerian \njudiciary's unwavering commitment to ensuring that no party is permitted to \nbenefit from deceitful, oppressive, or exploitative conduct, or from another's \nignorance or inability to comprehend complex legal documents. The case of \nIgbokwe v. U.B.N. Plc (2008) 12 NWLR (Pt. 1098) 332 further reinforces the \ncourts' vigilance against unconscionable transactions involving illiterates. \nIn the specific and troubling facts of this scenario, Alhaji Gudugudu, despite his \nilliteracy, is presumed to possess the legal capacity to contract. However, the \ncritical legal challenge arises from the conspicuous and profound failure to \ncomply with the mandatory protective mandates of the Illiterates Protection \nAct. The facts explicitly state that Alhaji Gudugudu \"could neither read, write \nnor understand English language,\" yet there is no mention whatsoever that the \n\"Land Sale Agreement\" was read over and explained to him in a language he \nfully understood. Furthermore, there is no indication of the presence of the \nstatutorily required Illiterate Jurat, nor are the details of the person who \nsupposedly read and explained the document included within it. This collective \nand glaring omission constitutes a direct violation of the Act's provisions, \nrendering the contract prima facie defective and, at the very least, voidable at \nAlhaji Gudugudu's instance, as established in Ameh v. Ilesanmi Press Ltd \n(1986) and U.A.C. v. Edems & Ajayi (1958). In any legal challenge, the burden \nof proof would shift to John Smith to affirmatively demonstrate that Alhaji \nGudugudu genuinely understood the contents of the document, a task that \nappears insurmountable given the stated facts and the absence of the \nstatutory safeguards, consistent with the rulings in Osefo v. Uwaifo (1976) and \nEze v. Okolonji (1997). \nMoreover, a fundamental and irreconcilable discrepancy exists between Alhaji \nGudugudu's clear and stated intention to enter into a 10-year lease agreement \nfor his 5 acres of land for a sum of ₦10 million, and the document that John \nSmith subsequently produced and had him thumb-print, which was \nunequivocally titled \"Land Sale Agreement\" and implied an outright sale. This \nprofound divergence between their respective intentions signifies a complete \nand utter absence of consensus ad idem. Alhaji Gudugudu genuinely believed \nhe was entering into one distinct type of transaction (a lease), while the \ndocument he signed represented a fundamentally different and more onerous \none (an outright sale). This situation strongly points towards either a \nfundamental mistake as to the very nature of the document being signed, \nwhich could potentially invoke the doctrine of non est factum and render the \ncontract void ab initio due to a lack of genuine consent, as discussed in Bell v. \nLever Bros Ltd (1932), or, more likely, a fraudulent misrepresentation on the \npart of John Smith, who deceptively drafted and presented a sale agreement \nwhen the clear understanding and agreement between the parties was for a \nlease. In either interpretation, such a fundamental mistake or fraudulent \nmisrepresentation serves to vitiate genuine consent, thereby making the \ncontract either void or, at the very least, voidable, consistent with principles \nfrom Smith v. Hughes (1871), Griffith v. Brymer (1903), and Scriven Bros v. \nHindley (1913). \nFinally, John Smith's conduct in actively exploiting Alhaji Gudugudu's illiteracy \nand vulnerability to secure a transaction that was fundamentally different from \nwhat was mutually agreed upon constitutes a clear instance of unconscionable \nbehaviour. This deliberate act of capitalizing on Alhaji Gudugudu's \ndisadvantage, particularly in a land transaction of significant value, would \nundoubtedly warrant equitable intervention by the Nigerian courts to prevent \na manifest injustice and to protect the vulnerable party from exploitation, \naligning with the principles established in Ajayi v. Texaco Nigeria Ltd (1987) \nand Ayoade v. Spring Bank Plc (2013), and further emphasized in Igbokwe v. \nU.B.N. Plc (2008). \nIn conclusion, the purported \"Land Sale Agreement\" between Alhaji Gudugudu \nand John Smith is highly unlikely to be upheld by Nigerian courts and is, in all \nprobability, legally invalid. The contract is fundamentally defective and is \npoised to be declared either void ab initio due to a profound fundamental \nmistake and a complete absence of consensus ad idem, or, at the very least, \nvoidable at Alhaji Gudugudu's instance. This voidability stems from John \nSmith's egregious non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of the \nIlliterates Protection Act and his clear act of misrepresentation. Furthermore, \nJohn Smith's actions, characterized by the exploitation of Alhaji Gudugudu's \nilliteracy and vulnerability, constitute unconscionable conduct, which principles \nof equity will not permit to stand. Consequently, Nigerian courts would almost \ncertainly set aside the purported \"sale agreement,\" declare it unenforceable, \nand are likely to grant appropriate equitable relief to Alhaji Gudugudu. John \nSmith's reliance on a document that was fraudulently presented to an illiterate \nparty will not withstand legal scrutiny, as the entire transaction fundamentally \noffends public policy, flagrantly violates the duty of fairness, and directly \nundermines the protective intent explicitly enshrined within Nigerian contract \nlaw. \n \nGENERAL CONCLUSION \nThe detailed analysis of these four distinct scenarios meticulously illustrates \nthe doctrine of contractual capacity. For minors, the law provides an extensive \nshield, particularly against contracts for non-necessaries. As seen in \nChukwuemeka's case, the classification of goods as \"necessaries\" is rigorously \napplied, with cases like Peters v. Fleming (1840) and Labinjoh v. Abake (1924) \nguiding the interpretation, ensuring that minors are bound only by agreements \nessential for their well-being and not by improvident bargains for luxury items. \nThe Infants Relief Act 1874 and common law principles, as exemplified by Leslie \nv. Sheill (1914) and Jennings v. Rundall (1799), combine to render such non-\nnecessary contracts either void or voidable, prioritizing the minor's protection \nover commercial expediency, a stance consistently upheld in Adegbite v. Lawal \n(2009). \nSimilarly, for persons of unsound mind and intoxicated individuals, the law \nrecognizes their diminished cognitive abilities. Contracts entered into by such \npersons are generally deemed voidable, provided the other contracting party \nwas aware of their incapacity, a principle firmly established in Imperial Loan \nCo. v. Stone (1892) and relevant in Akinfosile v. Ijose (1960). This protective \nstance is, however, balanced by a crucial exception for \"necessaries,\" as \nexplicitly provided by Section 3 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and exemplified \nby Mr. Digbolugi's purchase. This exception ensures that fundamental needs \ncan still be met, preventing a situation where incapacitated individuals are \ndenied essential goods and services due to their legal status. The underlying \npolicy here is to prevent unjust enrichment of the supplier while \nsimultaneously ensuring access to life's essentials. For intoxicated persons, the \ncourts also scrutinize for unconscionable bargaining, as seen in Olowu v. Olowu \n(1985) and Osho v. Foreign Finance Corp. (1991). \nThe position of illiterates in Nigerian contract law, as demonstrated by Alhaji \nGudugudu's predicament, reveals a unique and stringent set of statutory \nsafeguards. The Illiterates Protection Act imposes a heavy burden on the \nliterate party to ensure full disclosure and understanding, moving beyond \nmere awareness of incapacity to active verification. Cases like Ameh v. Ilesanmi \nPress Ltd (1986), U.A.C. v. Edems & Ajayi (1958), Osefo v. Uwaifo (1976), U.A.C. \n(Nig.) Ltd. v. Global Transport S.A. (1996), and Eze v. Okolonji (1997) \nconsistently reinforce these requirements. Failure to adhere to these \nmandatory provisions, especially when coupled with elements of \nmisrepresentation (as discussed in Smith v. Hughes (1871)), fundamental \nmistake (as in Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd (1932), Griffith v. Brymer (1903), and \nScriven Bros v. Hindley (1913)), or a complete absence of consensus ad idem, \ncan invalidate the agreement. This reflects a strong public policy against \nexploitation of the uneducated and a commitment to ensuring that consent in \nsuch agreements is truly informed. The courts' vigilance against \nunconscionable transactions, as illustrated by Ajayi v. Texaco Nigeria Ltd \n(1987), Ayoade v. Spring Bank Plc (2013), and Igbokwe v. U.B.N. Plc (2008), \nfurther strengthens the protection afforded to illiterates.", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 11.pdf"}

A clause in the trust deed \nstates that the beneficiaries shall be eligible and entitled to the benefits conferred upon \nthem when Idowu, who is the youngest child attains the age of 21. However, after the \nyoungest child turned 21 years, the trustee refuses the entreaties of the beneficiaries to \nconfer the trust benefits on them. Aggrieved, Taiwo, Kehinde and Idowu have \napproached you as a counsel.  \n \nAdvise them with the aid of relevant judicial authorities. \n \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis scenario primarily concerns the doctrine of privity of contract and its equitable \nexception through the concept of trust. The doctrine of privity holds that only parties to \na contract can enforce or be bound by its terms. This principle was affirmed by Lord \nHaldane in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v. Selfridge & Co Ltd1, where it was held \nthat \n“…Such a right may be conferred by way of property, as for example, under a trust, but it \ncannot be conferred on a stranger to a contract as a right in personam to enforce the \ncontract.”. \nHowever, equity recognises certain exceptions to the privity rule, one of the most \nsignificant being the creation of trusts. A trust arises where legal rights or property are \nconferred on a trustee for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary), even though that \nbeneficiary is not a party to the original contract. In such instances, equity permits the \nbeneficiary to enforce the terms of the trust against the trustee, thus enabling third-party \nenforcement without violating the privity doctrine. \nIn the present scenario, Mr. Jacobs, now deceased, executed a trust deed in favour of his \nthree children (Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu) stipulating that the trust benefits would \nbecome accessible once the youngest, Idowu, attained the age of 21. Despite the \ncondition having been fulfilled, the trustee, Mr. Adam Smith, has refused to confer the \nbenefits. This refusal gives rise to the following legal issues. \n \n \n \n1 Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v. Selfridge & Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 \n \n \n \nISSUES  \n1.​ Whether or not a valid trusteeship existed between Mr Jacobs and Adam Smith  \n \n2.​ Whether or not the trustee (Adam Smith) is in breach of trust and his fiduciary \nobligations by refusing to distribute the trust property after the stipulated condition \nwas fulfilled.  \n \n3.​  Whether or not the beneficiaries (Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu) have the right to \nbring an action against the trustee to confer the trust benefits on them, since the \ncondition has been fulfilled. \n \nISSUE 1: WHETHER OR NOT A VALID TRUSTEESHIP EXISTED BETWEEN \nMR. JACOBS AND ADAM SMITH \n \nRULE: \nA trust is a fiduciary relationship in which property is transferred by a settlor to a trustee \nto be held for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary). The legal requirements for \ncreating a valid trust are famously known as the three certainties: certainty of intention, \ncertainty of subject matter, and certainty of objects (beneficiaries), as laid down in \nKnight v. Knight (1840)2. It is not necessary that the word “trust” be used explicitly, as \nthe courts will look to the substance of the arrangement. In Paul v. Constance [1977]3, \n3 Paul v. Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527 \n2 Knight v. Knight (1840) 3 Beav. 148. \n \n \n \n \nthe Court held that the settlor’s clear conduct and words could be sufficient to infer an \nintention to create a trust. Similarly, in Ogunmefun v. Ogunmefun (1931)4, the Nigerian \ncourt affirmed that once a trust is created with certainty and the trustee accepts \nresponsibility, he becomes legally bound to administer the trust in accordance with its \nterms. \nIn addition, trust arrangements stand as equitable exceptions to the doctrine of privity of \ncontract. Although a third party generally cannot enforce a contract, beneficiaries under a \ntrust acquire equitable rights and can sue in equity. This exception has been recognized in \nnumerous cases including Gregory and Parker v. Williams (1816) and Lloyds v. \nHarper (1880)5 \n \nAPPLICATION: \nTo determine whether a valid trusteeship exists between Mr Jacobs and Adam Smith, the \nthree certainties as laid down in Knight v Knight (1840) (certainty of intention, certainty \nof subject matter, and certainty of objects) must be examined. \nThe requirement of certainty of intention is addressed by the fact that Mr Jacobs \nexecuted a formal trust deed, appointing Adam Smith as trustee for the benefit of his \nchildren, Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu. This deed sets out the purpose of the arrangement \nand the condition that Idowu must attain the age of 21 before benefits are conferred. Such \nexpress documentation mirrors the reasoning in Paul v Constance [1977], where the \ncourt considered conduct and words sufficient to constitute intention. The use of a \nformal deed in this case strengthens the indication of intent. This aligns with the \ndecision in Ogunmefun v Ogunmefun (1931), where the Nigerian court held that once a \n5 Lloyds v. Harper (1880) 16 Ch D 290. \n \n4 Ogunmefun v. Ogunmefun (1931) 10 NLR 82 \n \n \n \ntrust is created with certainty and the trustee accepts responsibility, he becomes legally \nbound. \nThe requirement of certainty of subject matter is met as the property or benefit to be held \nin trust is clearly identified within the deed. The trust property is not vague or \nindeterminate, satisfying the requirement that trust property must be clearly defined. \nWith regard to certainty of objects, the trust deed names Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu as \nthe beneficiaries. Their identities are specific and unambiguous, fulfilling the requirement \nthat the beneficiaries be clearly ascertainable. \nThe legal relationship arising from this trust arrangement also engages the equitable \nexception to the doctrine of privity of contract. Although third parties generally lack \nstanding to enforce a contract, beneficiaries under a trust acquire enforceable equitable \nrights. This principle was established in Gregory and Parker v Williams (1816) and \nreaffirmed in Lloyds v Harper (1880), both of which recognised the right of \nbeneficiaries to sue where a fiduciary duty is owed. \nThe facts reveal that Adam Smith accepted the trusteeship, thereby creating a fiduciary \nobligation to administer the trust according to its terms. As confirmed in Ogunmefun v \nOgunmefun, this acceptance triggers enforceable obligations in equity. The condition \nprecedent (that Idowu must attain the age of 21) has already been met, and the refusal of \nthe trustee to distribute the benefits engages the legal and equitable principles governing \nfiduciary conduct under trust law \n \nCONCLUSION: \nIt is therefore concluded that a valid trusteeship exists between Mr. Jacobs and Adam \nSmith. The trust deed executed by Mr. Jacobs satisfies all three certainties necessary for \nthe creation of a valid trust. The naming of specific beneficiaries, the clear stipulation of \n \n \n \nconditions, and the acceptance of responsibility by Adam Smith elevate the arrangement \nbeyond mere contract to a binding fiduciary relationship.  \n \nISSUE 2: WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUSTEE (ADAM SMITH) IS IN BREACH \nOF TRUST AND HIS FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS BY REFUSING TO \nDISTRIBUTE \nTHE \nTRUST \nPROPERTY \nAFTER \nTHE \nSTIPULATED \nCONDITION WAS FULFILLED \n \nRULE: \nA breach of trust occurs where a trustee fails to carry out the trust in accordance with its \nterms or acts contrary to their fiduciary duties. These fiduciary duties include loyalty, \ngood faith, and acting solely in the interest of the beneficiaries. In Tito v. Waddell6, it \nwas held that trustees are bound to adhere strictly to the terms of the trust. \nFurthermore, in Tempest v. Lord Camoys (1882)7, it was held that trustees cannot \narbitrarily withhold trust property from beneficiaries once the conditions for enjoyment \nhave been fulfilled. In Armitage v. Nurse [1998]8, Millet LJ stated that the core \nobligation of a trustee is to act honestly and in good faith in accordance with the terms \nof the trust. \n \nAPPLICATION: \nIn the present case, Adam Smith’s refusal to confer the benefits upon Taiwo, Kehinde, \nand Idowu after Idowu had turned 21 directly violates the condition laid out in the trust \n8 Armitage v. Nurse [1998] Ch 241 \n7 Tempest v. Lord Camoys (1882) 21 Ch D 571 \n6 Tito v. Waddell (No 2) [1977] Ch 106, \n \n \n \ndeed. The duty to distribute the trust property matured upon fulfillment of the stated \ncondition. By withholding the trust assets despite this, he is acting contrary to his \nfiduciary duty to act in good faith and follow the terms of the trust. \nThere is no discretionary power or future interest retained in the trust instrument that \nwould justify the delay. His action is in accordance with what is regarded as breach of \ntrust as defined in Tito v. Waddell and Tempest v. Lord Camoys. As further affirmed in \nRe Smith [1928] trustees must act once legal conditions are fulfilled. \n \nCONCLUSION: \nAdam Smith is in breach of trust and fiduciary obligations for failing to distribute the \ntrust property after the stipulated condition (Idowu turning 21) was fulfilled. \n \n \nISSUE 3: WHETHER OR NOT THE BENEFICIARIES (TAIWO, KEHINDE, \nAND IDOWU) HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING AN ACTION AGAINST THE \nTRUSTEE TO CONFER THE TRUST BENEFITS ON THEM, SINCE THE \nCONDITION HAS BEEN FULFILLED \n \nRULE: \nUnder the rule in Saunders v. Vautier (1841)9, where all the beneficiaries of a trust are \nof full age (sui juris) and are absolutely entitled to the trust property, they may \n9 Saunders v. Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115 \n \n \n \ncollectively terminate the trust and compel the trustee to transfer the trust property to \nthem, even if the trust deed prescribes a later time. \nThis principle was affirmed in Re Smith [1928]10, where the court compelled trustees to \ntransfer trust property once the beneficiaries met the stipulated criteria. \nFurthermore, where a trustee mismanages a trust or refuses to fulfill his duties, the \nbeneficiaries are entitled to approach the court for an order compelling performance, \nremoval of the trustee, or even compensation. \n \nAPPLICATION: \nIn this case, Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu are now all of full age, with Idowu being the last \nto attain 21 years. They have a vested and absolute interest in the trust property, and have \njointly agreed to claim the benefits conferred upon them by the trust. There are no \ncontingent or competing interests in the trust property. \nBy the equitable principle in Saunders v. Vautier, they have the right to demand \ntermination of the trust and transfer of the property.  \n \nCONCLUSION: \nAdam Smith’s continued refusal not only constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty but opens \nhim to equitable action by the beneficiaries. \nTaiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu have the legal right to bring an action against Adam Smith to \ncompel performance of the trust and confer the benefits due to them. \n \n10 Re Smith [1928] Ch 915 \n \n \n \nConclusively, while the doctrine of privity of contract excludes third parties from \nenforcing contractual obligations, equity provides an exception where a valid trust is \ncreated for their benefit. In this case, it is evident from the facts and legal analysis that \nMr. Jacobs lawfully created a trust in favour of his children. Adam Smith, having \naccepted the role of trustee, is bound to act in accordance with the trust deed. His refusal \nto distribute the trust benefits now that the stipulated age requirement has been met \nconstitutes a breach of trust. \nAccordingly, we humbly advise the beneficiaries (Taiwo, Kehinde, and Idowu) to \ninstitute legal proceedings against Adam Smith to enforce the trust and compel the \ndistribution of the trust property. The law of equity stands firmly on their side, and the \ncourt is likely to uphold their right to the trust benefits.", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 12.pdf"}

The instant case provides a pertinent  of the complexities arising when one \ncontracting party lacks such full legal capacity, specifically concerning the involvement of a \nminor. \n \nThis analysis will meticulously examine the purported contractual relationship between Otondo, \na 13-year-old, and Tomboy Car Hire Services, with a primary focus on the enforceability of the \nagreement under the principles of Nigerian contract law. The discourse will critically evaluate \nthe general common law position concerning contracts entered into by minors, distinguishing \nbetween those that are voidable at the minor's option and the limited category of agreements, \nsuch as those for necessaries, which may be binding. Furthermore, the inquiry will extend to \nassessing the legal ramifications of alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the minor regarding \nhis age at the time of contract formation, scrutinizing whether such deceit alters the fundamental \nprotection afforded to minors or introduces alternative avenues for redress for the adult party. \nThis analysis aims to delineate the respective rights and liabilities of the parties within the \nestablished framework of contract jurisprudence. \n \nThe analysis will be done under these three (3) identifiable  issues. \n \n-​\nIssue 1: Whether or not Otondo is liable for the damage of the car \n \n-​\nIssue 2: Whether or not the hired car was a necessity \n \n-​\nIssue 3: Whether Otondo's alleged misrepresentation of his age affects the contract \n \n \n3 \n \nISSUE ONE \nWHETHER OR NOT OTONDO IS LIABLE FOR THE DAMAGE OF THE \nCAR \n \nThe central point of contention revolves around the legal capacity to enter into a binding \ncontract. To establish this, the general contractual principles concerning liability for damages, \nconsidering both express and implied terms that might typically govern such an agreement will \nbe considered and, subsequently,  the specific legal safeguards provided to minors (infants)  \nunder contract law, particularly focusing on the implications of the Infants Relief Act (and \nequivalent Nigerian legislation). By applying these established legal rules and principles, it will \nbe ascertained whether the infant possessed the necessary capacity to contract, and consequently, \nwhether he can be held liable for the car's damage. \n \nCONTRACTUAL TERMS REGARDING LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES  \nContractual terms regarding liability for damages are provisions within a contract that define the \nextent to which a party is responsible for harm or loss arising from a breach or other issues. \nThese terms aim to allocate risk between the parties. The terms can include limitations on the \ntypes or amounts of damages recoverable, or even completely exclude liability under certain \ncircumstances. Some types include: \n \n1. Exclusion Clauses \nThese clauses exclude one party’s liability for damages caused by breach or other circumstances. \nThe purpose of this is to protect a party from certain types of claims. It is often used to avoid \nliability for indirect or unforeseeable damages. \"The vendor shall not be liable for any loss of \nprofit, business, or consequential damages arising from the use of the product.\"  The quotation is \nan example of an exclusion clause. The clause must be unambiguous to avoid disputes, because \nthe courts may not enforce clauses perceived as overly one-sided, especially in consumer \ncontracts. Exclusion Clause has been clearly explained by Per Onyemenam, JCA in Chevron \nLtd. V. Titan Energy Ltd. And also, in S.P.D.C. Nigeria Ltd v. Anaro (2015), the Supreme Court \nemphasized that exclusion clauses must be expressly agreed upon and should not contravene \nstatutory provisions or public policy. \n4 \n \n \n2. Limitation Clauses \nThese clauses cap (limits) the maximum liability of a party, irrespective of the actual damages \nincurred. This helps to provide predictability in financial exposure and encourage manageable \nrisk allocation. The contractor’s liability for any breach of contract shall not exceed the contract \nvalue. In jurisdictions like the UK, courts evaluate whether the limitation is fair and reasonable \nunder the circumstances. In Eko Hotels Ltd v. Bokor (2012), the Court of Appeal held that \nlimitation clauses must be brought to the attention of the other party at the time of contract \nformation. \n \n3. Indemnity Clauses \nThese terms obligate one party (the indemnifier) to compensate the other (the indemnitee) for \nspecific losses, often caused by third-party actions.This is meant to shift risk from one party to \nanother and cover for liabilities arising outside the immediate control of the indemnitee. For \nexample, \"The supplier agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the buyer against any \nclaims, liabilities, or damages arising from intellectual property infringement.\" In Niger \nInsurance Co. Ltd v. Abed Brothers Ltd (1976), the Supreme Court enforced the indemnity \nclause, as it was clear and unambiguous. \n \n4. Liquidated Damages Clauses \nThis predetermines a fixed sum payable in case of specific breaches, such as delays or \nnon-performance. The purpose is to provide certainty and avoid lengthy disputes over damages \nand act as a deterrent to breaches. An example is \"In the event of project delay, the contractor \nshall pay $1,000 per day as liquidated damages.\" A.G. Rivers State v. A.G. Federation (2006). \nIt was affirmed that Liquidated damages clauses are enforceable when they reflect anticipated \nlosses and are not unconscionable. \n \n5. Warranty and Guarantee Terms \nThese terms outline obligations regarding product or service quality and liabilities for defects. \nThey clearly outline what constitutes a defect and what remedies are available and also specify \nthe warranty period. The purpose is to ensure the goods / services meet agreed standards. An \n5 \n \nexample is,\"The seller guarantees that the software will be free from defects for 12 months and \nwill repair or replace defective software at no additional cost.\" In Incar Nigeria Ltd v. Benson \nTransport Ltd (1975), it was held that warranties must be expressly stated or implied based on \nthe nature of the transaction. \n \nContractual terms may be express, or implied depending on how the terms are established and \nincorporated into the contract. \n \n1. Express Terms: These are terms that are explicitly stated and agreed upon by the parties \nduring the formation of the contract. They are either written or spoken and leave no ambiguity \nabout their inclusion in the agreement. Some characteristics of an express contract include: clear \ndefinition, mutual agreement and legally binding. An example is where a delivery clause \nspecifying; “The goods must be delivered by June 30\"  In Bristol Tramways Carriage Co. v. \nFiat Motors Ltd (1910): The court held that express terms agreed upon by parties take \nprecedence over any implied terms unless they contradict statutory obligations. \n \n2. Implied Terms: These are terms that are not expressly stated in the contract but are included \nby operation of law, custom, or the presumed intention of the parties. Courts may imply terms to \nensure fairness or to give the contract business efficacy. \n \nSources of Implied Terms \na. By Law (Statutory): Terms imposed by legislation, such as the Sale of Goods Act or \nEmployment Laws. For example, under the Sale of Goods Act, goods sold must be of \nmerchantable quality. \nb. By Fact (Presumed Intentions): Based on what the parties would have agreed to if they had \nconsidered the issue. For instance, In a lease agreement, the landlord is expected to maintain the \nproperty in a habitable condition. \nc. By Custom/Usage: Terms implied by trade practices or customs known to both parties. \nFor example, a contract in the shipping industry might include standard terms recognized \nglobally. \n6 \n \nd. To Give Business Efficacy: Terms implied to make the contract workable. For instance, In \nThe Moorcock (1889), the court implied a term that a wharf owner must ensure a safe berth for a \nmoored ship. Also, in Liverpool City Council v. Irwin (1977), The House of Lords implied a \nterm into a lease agreement that the landlord must maintain common areas, even though it was \nnot explicitly stated. \n \nEXAMINATION OF CAPACITY TO CONTRACT \nIn Kabo Air v. Tarfa, Galadima, J.C.A, as he was then, held that a contract must be an \nagreement which is legally binding on the parties to it and which, if broken, may be enforced by \naction in court against the defaulting party. This means that a contract is an agreement that both \nparties intended to be binding on them and enforceable by the court if there is a breach. This \nshows that the basic rule of a contract is that it is binding on the parties. There are basic elements \nin which a contract must embody for it to be valid, binding and enforceable in court. They are \noffer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relations and capacity to contract, of \nwhich capacity to contract will be examined critically.  \n \nIn law, the capacity of the parties that make a contract is pivotal to the validity and \nenforceability or otherwise of the contract. There are some categories of people in law who \nenjoy special privilege due to their mental capacity which is deduced to be lesser than that of an \nordinary man at the point of entering into a contract which makes them lack the capacity to \ncontract. Therefore, any contract entered into by this category of people will be null and void. \nThis privilege is given to them as a form of protection against being exploited or defrauded in the \nmaking of a contract. This category of people include; the illiterate, the infant, the drunken \nperson and a lunatic. \n \nAn illiterate person lacks the capacity to contract as the person, according to Oputa J, \" is a \nperson who is unable to read with understanding, the document made or prepared on his \nbehalf…\" which in turn makes the contract to lack the essential ingredient of consensus ad idem \nwhich means the meeting of minds. There cannot be said to be a contract where only one party to \nthe contract understands the terms of the contract and the other party who is illiterate does not. \nLaws in protection of the rights of an illiterate are the Illiterate Protection Act and the Land \n7 \n \nInstruments Registration Law. Cases that point to the lack of capacity to contract of an illiterate \nare P.Z & C.O. Ltd v. Gusau and Kantoma, where the High Court defined what illiterate means, \nthe case of Osefo v. Uwania, S.C.OA. Zaria v. Okon, U.A.C. v. Edems & Ajayi, etc. \n \nAlso, an infant lacks the capacity to contract as he or she is assumed to lack the mental capacity \nto enter into a contract which can lead to the deception of the infant. The common law and \nInfant Relief Act of 1874 provides protection of an infant by the contact being voidable at the \noption of the infant, i.e it is not binding on the infant but binding on the other party as the \ncommon law posits. The infant is only liable for contracts of necessaries and beneficial contracts \nof service. It was stated by common law that the age at which someone ceases to be regarded as \nan infant under the law is the age of 21 years and this has been contested in Nigeria as seen in the \ncase of Labinjoh v. Abake, where it was settled that any commercial transaction governed by \nEnglish law, whether statutory, common law, received or local, the age of majority is 21 in \nNigeria, notwithstanding what the customary law states. \n \nIn the case of a lunatic or a drunken person, they also lack the capacity to contract as they are not \nmentally stable to intentionally enter into a contract. So, therefore, in the case where the contract \nwas not for necessaries, the onus lies on them to prove that they did not understand what they \nwere doing at that time and that the other person was aware of their condition and still went \nahead with the contract with the aim of defrauding them. For a drunk person, it is easily \nnoticeable but this may not be the same for a lunatic. Nevertheless, contract entered by either of \nthem in their lucid period is seen as valid, binding and enforceable in the court of law. The case \nof Brown v. Jodrell states the onus to be proved by the lunatic person to prove his or her lunacy. \n \nFrom the foregoing, the absence of \"consensus ad idem\" in the contracts made with an illiterate \nperson, an infant, a lunatic or a drunk makes such contact null, void, not binding and \nunenforceable in court and therefore negates the existence of a valid contract. These categories \nof people are regarded as disadvantaged and are protected against being deceived or defrauded \ninto a contract by the laws made for them. They do not have the capacity to contract and entering \ninto a contract with them is at the detriment of the other party as the contract cannot be enforced \nagainst them if there is a breach of contract. This, therefore portrays this element of contract as \n8 \n \ncrucial to the making of a valid and enforceable contract without which, even with the presence \nof all other elements, a contract will not be seen to have existed at all as an omission of one of \nthese elements negates the whole contract. \nRELEVANCE OF SECTION 3 OF THE INFANT RELIEF ACT  \n \nThe infant relief act overall states and explains the capacity of an infant to contract.  It outlines \nthe conditions for the contract with an infant to be void and the conditions for the ratification of a \ncontract as entered into by an infant. By virtue of section 3 of the act, no action can be brought \nagainst an infant when he comes of age, for the contract he made while still an infant. It states: \n \n“No action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon any promise made after full \nage to pay any debt contracted during infancy, or upon any ratification made after full age of \nany promise or contract made during infancy, whether there shall or shall not be any new \nconsideration for such promise or ratification after full age.” \n \nA summary of the implication of section 1 and 3 of the Infant Relief Act was made in Sagay. He \nsummarizes it in four points. He states that;  \n\"(a)All contracts of loan for non-necessary goods and accounts stated are absolutely void. \n(b) Contracts for necessary goods and beneficial contracts of service, remain absolutely \nbinding on the infant. \n (c) Contracts which are binding on the infant, unless repudiated by him either during Infancy \nor within a reasonable period after the attainment of majority remain unchanged and \nunaffected by the act. These are contracts in which the infant acquires an interest in property, \nof a permanent nature, with continuing obligations attached to it. Examples are contracts for \nthe purchase of shares in a company, partnership agreements, etc.  \n(d) Contracts which were not binding on an infant, unless ratified by him after the attainment \nof majority, were no longer ratifiable by him after majority.\" \n \nThis therefore shows that a contract entered by an infant is automatically void, the only \nexception is if it is a contract for necessary goods and if the infant ratified the contract, during a \nreasonable time at the attainment of majority age (within a reasonable period). The term \n“necessaries” has been examined and explained over time. According to Section 2 of the Sale of \n9 \n \nGoods Act necessary goods are defined as “ goods suitable to the condition in life of such an \ninfant or minor or other person, and to the actual requirements at the time of sale and delivery” \nwhich means that  for certain goods to be considered as necessary goods, they have to be \nimportant to the living conditions of an infant. For instance, in Roberts v. Gray, an infant, was \nheld liable for an executory contract for education and training. Although what the infant \npurchased here were services, it still extends to goods to an extent. \n \nApart from the definition of necessaries by the Sale of Goods Act, Lord Alderson B. in Chapple \nv. Cooper explains that food, clothes and raiment were necessaries. He also explains that “... it \nmust be first be made out that the class itself is one in which the things furnished are essential to \nthe existence and reasonable advantage and comfort of the infant contractor. Thus, articles of \nmere luxury are always excluded, though luxurious articles of utility are in some cases allowed.\" \nFrom the explanation given by Lord Alderson, it can be inferred that for items to be termed \nnecessaries, their class must not be higher than the class of the infant. For example, an infant \nwhose guardians struggle to provide three meals a day cannot be liable for buying a gold wrist \nwatch, costing a million US dollars. Other forms of necessaries include, apprenticeship and other \nbeneficial contracts of service. \n \nIMPLICATION OR RELEVANCE TO THE CASE STUDY  \nIt shows that for the corporation to sue, they have to prove that the hiring of the car was a \nnecessary good for Otondo. That is, other options like walking and hailing a taxi to his friend's \nparty or place are options he can't consider by virtue of his status, wealth of his parents or maybe \nhealth. This is almost impossible to prove because it is  stated that Otondo lives in “Ajegunle”, \nsomewhere not for people with very high status. Unless, he has a health condition that only \nallows him to hire cabs, thus making the car hire a necessary goods. If not, the contract becomes \nvoid, by virtue of section 1 of the Infant Relief Act of  1874. If Otondo ratifies the contract \nwithin a reasonable time upon the attainment of age of majority, then the amount of the losses \ncan be recovered which still relies on Otondo's decision. So, either way, Tomboy Car Hire will \nbe at a disadvantage if they sue. \n      \nRULES OF LAW IN ISSUE 1 \n10 \n \nThe fundamental principle governing this case is that an infant (minor) generally lacks the full \ncapacity to enter into binding contracts. This is firmly established under common law and \nsignificantly reinforced by statute, specifically Section 1 of the Infants Relief Act. This Act \nexplicitly declares that \"All contracts, whether by specialty or by simple contract, henceforth \nentered into by infants for the repayment of money lent or to be lent, or for goods supplied or \nto be supplied (other than contracts for necessaries), and all accounts stated with infants, shall \nbe absolutely void.\" \n It is crucial to note that this statutory provision does not invalidate existing contracts an infant \nmay enter into by other statutes, common law, or equity, except those already considered \nvoidable. \n Furthermore, while express terms in a contract typically take precedence over implied terms, as \nestablished in cases like Bristol Tramways Carriage Co. v. Fiat Motors Ltd (1910), this is only \ntrue unless they contradict statutory obligations. An exception to the general rule of \nunenforceability for minor's contracts is when the goods or services provided are classified as \n\"necessaries.\" Even then, a minor is typically only liable to pay a reasonable price, not \nnecessarily the contractually agreed price.  \nLastly, recovery of losses might be possible if the infant willingly ratifies the contract upon \nreaching the age of majority. The overarching legal stance is protective of infants, operating on \nthe assumption that due to their age, they lack the mental capacity for true consensus ad idem \n(meeting of the minds) when contracting, thus shielding them from being defrauded. \n \nAPPLICATION \nApplying these established rules to the present scenario, Tomboy Car Hire Service faces a \nsignificant hurdle in suing Otondo for damages. Despite the existence of an express contractual \nterm stating that \"the hirer shall be liable for any damage to the car,\" this term cannot be \nenforced against Otondo. As a 13-year-old, he falls squarely within the category of an infant, \ndirectly protected by Section 1 of the Infants Relief Act. Any attempt to enforce contractual \nliability for damages against him would contradict this statutory protection. Crucially, the \"hiring \nof the car\" for the purpose of attending a party is demonstrably not a \"necessary good\" in this \n11 \n \nsituation; it is recreational and not essential for his survival or well-being. Therefore, Tomboy \nCar Hire Services' attempt to sue for damages will likely fail because Otondo is an infant, and \nthe service contracted for is not a necessary. While there is a remote possibility of recovery if \nOtondo willingly ratifies the contract after attaining the age of majority, if he declines, Tomboy \nCar Hire Services' most practical option would be to absorb the losses. Given Otondo's age and \nthe protective common law principles and the Infants Relief Act, the law presumes a lack of \ncontractual capacity, thereby accentuating his non-liability for the damages incurred. \n \nISSUE TWO:  \nWHETHER OR NOT THE HIRED CAR WAS A NECCESITY? \nIn the law of contract, there are certain situations where a person who ordinarily wouldn’t have \nthe full capacity to enter into a contract (like a minor or a lunatic) can still be held liable. One of \nthose situations is when the contract is for necessaries. These are goods or services that are \nessential for everyday life, such as food, shelter, clothes, and medical care. They are vital for a \nperson's survival, well-being, and general standard of living. In the context of contract law, \nparticularly concerning minors, necessaries refer to items or services a minor is legally permitted \nto contract for and be held liable to pay for, recognizing that despite their limited contractual \ncapacity, they still need essential goods and services. As a result, contracts for necessaries are \ntreated as valid and enforceable, but only to the extent that the goods or services genuinely \nqualify as such. \nFor a contract to be classified as one for necessaries, two conditions must be satisfied: \n(1) The goods or services must be suitable to the condition in life of the minor (their social or \neconomic status); and \n(2) It must be a necessity as at the time the contract was entered into. \nThis principle was emphasized in the case of NASH V. INMAN (1908), where a tailor sued a \nminor for the cost of several waistcoats. The court held that although clothing could generally be \nconsidered a necessity, the minor already possessed sufficient clothing, and therefore the \n12 \n \nadditional garments did not count as a necessity. The case established that necessity is both a \nfunctional and factual determination, depending not just on the nature of the goods, but also on \nwhether the minor truly needs them at that time. Examples of necessaries may include food, \nclothing, accommodation, education, medical care, and in some cases, transportation. On the \ncontrary, luxuries, entertainment, and non-essential services are not considered necessaries, and \ncontracts involving them are typically void or voidable at the minor’s option. \nAnother relevant case is RYDER V. WOMBWELL (1844). In this case, an infant purchased a \npair of expensive wine glasses and a decorative ring from a tradesman. The tradesman later sued \nfor the price, arguing that the items were necessaries. The minor argued that he was not liable \nbecause the items were not essential to his maintenance or well-being. The court held that the \ngoods were not necessaries under law and therefore could not be enforced against him. \nIn relation to Otondo’s case, Otondo is a 13-year-old minor who hired a car from Tomboy Car \nHire Services to attend a party with friends. The use of the car was clearly recreational, not \nessential. In Otondo’s case, the hired car was neither necessary for his survival nor required for \nhis well-being. Furthermore, since he is legally too young to hold a driver’s license in Nigeria, it \nis unlikely that the hiring of a car by a 13-year-old can ever be viewed as appropriate. The nature \nand purpose of the hire (transportation to a social event) categorically places the contract outside \nthe scope of necessaries. \nAlthough the Nigerian Constitution (1999, as amended) does not specifically address contracts \nfor necessaries, we rely largely on the Received English Laws which include the English \ncommon law, equity, and statutes of general application (that applied before January 1, 1900). \nThis is backed by Section 45 of the Interpretation Act, which allows Nigerian courts to use these \nsources when there’s no direct local legislation. Also, the Sale of Goods Act 1893, which is part \nof our law through reception, defines “necessaries” under Section 3 as: \n“goods suitable to the condition in life of the minor or other person, and to his actual \nrequirements at the time of the sale and delivery.” \nWe also have the Nigerian case of Labinjo v. Abake (1924), where the court listed basic needs \nlike food, clothing, lodging, and education as examples of necessaries. The court emphasized \n13 \n \nthat these must be reasonable and actually required by the person at the time. Also, in Edokpolo \n& Co Ltd v. Ohenhen (1994), the Supreme Court highlighted that even if something looks \nnecessary, it won’t be enforceable if it’s excessive or doesn't match the person’s actual needs or \nsocial standing. \nA minor or a lunatic won’t be held liable for the full contract price but will have to pay a \nreasonable price for the necessaries. This was seen in Peters v. Fleming (1840), where a minor \nwas made to pay for items that were genuinely useful and necessary to his education and social \nrole. \nUnder common law principles, minors generally lack the legal capacity to enter into binding \ncontracts, and contracts made by them are typically voidable at their option and largely \nunenforceable against them. Otondo, at 13 years old, falls squarely within this protected \ncategory, reflecting the law's protective stance toward those deemed unable to fully understand \ncontractual obligations. \nThe Infants Relief Act creates a crucial exception to this general rule, allowing minors to be \nbound by contracts for \"necessaries.\" This provision ensures minors can obtain essential items \nwhile protecting them from exploitation. \nHowever, the car hire in this case fails to meet the necessaries test on multiple grounds. First, \ntransportation for recreational purposes does not constitute a basic need for survival or \nreasonable living standards. Second, the specific purpose – attending a party – demonstrates the \nnon-essential nature of the contract. Third, alternative means of transportation were presumably \navailable, making the hired car a luxury rather than a necessity. The Act's protective framework \ntherefore applies, rendering the damage liability clause unenforceable against Otondo. \nSince the car hire agreement was not for necessaries, the express contractual term holding \nthe \"hirer liable for damages\" cannot be enforced against Otondo. The contract is \nvoidable, and the minor cannot be held to its terms. Tomboy Car Hire Services' prospects \nof recovery appear extremely poor, as the law prioritizes protecting minors from \nimprovident agreements over commercial certainty. \n14 \n \nWhile Tomboy Car Hire Services may explore alternative avenues such as parental liability or \ninsurance claims, their direct action against Otondo is likely to fail. The case demonstrates the \nrobust protection afforded to minors in contract law, even when their actions result in significant \nfinancial consequences for other parties. The company's failure to verify Otondo's age and \ncapacity before entering the agreement may ultimately prove costly, highlighting the importance \nof due diligence in commercial transactions. \nThe broader implications of this case extend beyond the immediate parties. It reinforces the \npolicy rationale behind the Infants Relief Act—that society has a compelling interest in \nprotecting children from the consequences of their immature judgment in commercial dealings. \nThe law recognizes that minors lack the experience and understanding necessary to make \ninformed contractual decisions, particularly regarding long-term financial obligations. \nFrom a commercial perspective, this case serves as a cautionary tale for businesses dealing with \nyoung customers. Companies must implement robust age verification procedures and consider \nthe legal risks of contracting with minors. The harsh reality is that while the minor receives legal \nprotection, the commercial party bears the full risk of any resulting losses. \nFurthermore, this case highlights the potential gap between moral and legal responsibility. While \nOtondo may be morally culpable for the damage caused by his negligent driving, the law \nprioritizes his protection as a minor over the commercial interests of the hire company. This \nseparation of moral fault from legal liability demonstrates the paternalistic nature of contract law \nconcerning minors. \nThe decision also raises questions about parental supervision and responsibility. Although \nOtondo cannot be held contractually liable, his parents may face scrutiny regarding their duty of \ncare and potential negligent supervision. Courts may examine whether reasonable parental \noversight could have prevented the incident, opening alternative avenues for recovery. \nFrom a public policy standpoint, the case underscores the need for clearer guidelines in \nindustries that might interact with minors. The car hire industry, in particular, should develop \nstandardized practices for age verification and risk assessment to prevent similar situations. \n15 \n \nLegislative consideration might be given to specific provisions addressing high-risk activities \ninvolving minors. \nUltimately, the case illustrates the tension between protecting vulnerable minors and maintaining \ncommercial certainty. The law clearly prioritizes the former, leaving businesses to manage the \nassociated risks through careful screening procedures and comprehensive insurance coverage. \nTomboy Car Hire Services' predicament demonstrates that ignorance of a contracting party's \nminority status provides no legal refuge when seeking to enforce contractual obligations. This \ncase serves as a stark reminder that in the balance between commercial expediency and child \nprotection, the law invariably favors the latter, regardless of the financial consequences for adult \nparties. \nB. Would your answer be different where Otondo lied to \nTomboy Car Hire Services at the time of entering the contract \nthat he was 25 years old? \nIssue 3: Whether Otondo’s Alleged Misrepresentation of His \nAge Affects the Contract \nIn contract law, misrepresentation is a significant concept that directly impacts the validity and \nenforceability of an agreement. This issue critically examines whether Otondo’s false statement \nabout his age – claiming to be 25 when he was 13 – affects the car hire contract with Tomboy \nCar Hire Services. Specifically, it explores how this misrepresentation influences the contract's \nenforceability and whether Tomboy Car Hire Services can recover damages for the extensively \ndamaged vehicle. To thoroughly analyze this, it is essential to define the types of \nmisrepresentation, outline their required elements, apply these principles to Otondo's conduct, \nand consider the available remedies and their practical implications, particularly concerning the \ncontractual capacity of a minor under Nigerian law. \nTYPES OF MISREPRESENTATION IN CONTRACT LAW  \n16 \n \nMisrepresentation is fundamentally a false statement of material fact made by one party that \ninduces another to enter into a contract. As a vitiating factor, it has the potential to render a \ncontract voidable.  Misrepresentation is broadly classified into three types: \n1.​ Innocent Misrepresentation: This occurs when the false statement is made honestly, \nwith a genuine belief in its truth, even though it is factually incorrect. The maker is \nunaware of the statement's falsity (e.g., Witney v. Seal Hyne). \n2.​ Negligent Misrepresentation: This arises when a false statement is made carelessly or \nwithout reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. This typically occurs where a duty \nof care exists between the representor and the representee (e.g., Hedley Byrne & Co v. \nHeller & Partners Ltd [1963] AC 465). \n3.​ Fraudulent Misrepresentation: This is the most severe form, as defined by Lord \nHerschell in Derry v. Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337. It involves a false statement made: \n-​\nKnowingly, or \n-​\nWithout belief in its truth, or \n-​\nRecklessly, careless as to whether it is true or false. \nIn such instances, dishonesty or recklessness is central to establishing fraud (e.g., Sule v. \nArmoire). \nELEMENTS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH MISREPRESENTATION  \nFor a successful claim of misrepresentation, several key elements must be conclusively \ndemonstrated: \n1.​ False Statement of Fact: The representation must be a false statement of existing or past \nfact, not merely an opinion, future intention, or statement of law. While an opinion or \nintention typically does not constitute misrepresentation, an exception arises if the maker \nof the statement does not genuinely hold that opinion or intention (e.g., Udogwu v. Oki; \nBisset v Wilkinson [1927] AC 177). \n2.​ Made by the Representor: The false statement must have originated from one party to \nthe other. \n17 \n \n3.​ Inducement: The false statement must have induced the representee to enter into the \ncontract. It must be material and demonstrably influenced the party’s decision (e.g., \nEdgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459). \n4.​ Reliance: The representee must have reasonably relied on the false statement when \nentering into the agreement. \nDOES OTONDO’S MISREPRESENTATION OF HIS AGE CONSTITUTE A \nVALID DEFENSE? \nApplying these principles to the facts, Otondo, a 13-year-old, falsely claimed to be 25 years old \nto secure a car from Tomboy Car Hire Services. This was a deliberate false statement of fact, \nsatisfying the first element of misrepresentation. The statement was made at the time of contract \nformation, and it clearly induced and was relied upon by Tomboy Car Hire Services. It is highly \nimprobable that a commercial car hire company would knowingly contract with a minor for a \nvehicle, especially one intended for a party, a setting with inherent risks. Otondo's knowledge \nthat he was not 25 and his intent to obtain the car by this false statement strongly indicate \nfraudulent misrepresentation under the Derry v. Peek definition. \nHowever, the crucial complicating factor is Otondo's status as a minor. Under Nigerian law, a \nminor (generally defined as a person under 18 years, though for contract purposes, common law \noften refers to 21 years) lacks full contractual capacity. Contracts entered into with minors are \ngenerally voidable at the minor's option, meaning the minor can choose to enforce or repudiate \nthe contract. A significant exception applies to contracts for \"necessaries\" – goods or services \nessential for the minor’s existence and suitable to their condition in life (e.g., Nash v Inman \n[1908]. A car hired for a party is demonstrably not a necessary; thus, the contract with Otondo \nwould, even without misrepresentation, be considered non-binding and voidable at his instance. \nThe legal position regarding a minor's fraudulent misrepresentation of age is illuminated by the \nseminal case of Leslie v Sheill [1914] 3 KB 607. In this case, the court held that a minor who \nfraudulently misrepresented his age to obtain a loan could not be held liable in tort for deceit to \neffectively enforce a contract that was otherwise voidable due to infancy. The court's rationale \nwas rooted in public policy, aiming to protect minors from contractual liability, even where \n18 \n \ndeceit is involved, preventing the adult party from using a tort claim to indirectly circumvent the \nminor’s contractual incapacity. \nApplying Leslie v Sheill to Otondo's situation, even though his misrepresentation about his age \namounts to fraudulent conduct, it does not override the fundamental legal protection afforded to \nhim as a minor. The courts are reluctant to permit a tort claim (such as deceit) if it effectively \nserves to enforce a contract that is otherwise unenforceable against a minor. Therefore, Otondo’s \nmisrepresentation, while fraudulent, does not bind him to the contract, nor does it make him \nliable for damages in a way that would indirectly enforce the car hire agreement. \n \nREMEDIES FOR MISREPRESENTATION AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS  \nThe typical remedies for misrepresentation include rescission and damages. \n1.​ Rescission: This involves setting aside the contract and restoring both parties to their \npre-contractual positions. While rescission is the primary remedy, its feasibility in this \nscenario is limited as the car has been extensively damaged, making restitution in \nintegrum (restoration to the original position) impossible. \n2.​ Damages: For fraudulent misrepresentation, damages are ordinarily awarded in tort for \ndeceit, aiming to put the injured party back in the position they were in before the \ncontract (e.g., Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158). However, the critical \nimplication for Tomboy Car Hire Services is the Leslie v Sheill principle. This case \nseverely restricts the recovery of damages from a minor for misrepresentation if doing so \nwould indirectly enforce a voidable contract. \n3.​ Equitable Relief/Restitution: While there might be a very limited scope for equitable \nrelief or quasi-contract to prevent unjust enrichment, courts are generally disinclined to \ngrant such claims if they circumvent the minor's legal incapacity (e.g., Valentine v Henry \n(1934) NLR 19). Restitution may only be ordered if it is possible to return specific goods \nor money still in the minor's possession, not to recover damages for a contractual breach \nor tort that effectively enforces the contract. \n19 \n \nOtondo’s false statement regarding his age constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation. However, \nhis status as a minor provides him with substantial protection under Nigerian contract law. The \ncourts consistently uphold the principle that contracts for non-necessaries entered into by \nminors are voidable, and crucially, a minor cannot be held liable in tort for fraud if such \nliability would effectively enforce a contract otherwise unenforceable due to infancy. \nConsequently, despite the clear dishonesty involved, the car hire contract is unlikely to be \nenforceable against Otondo, and Tomboy Car Hire Services will face significant difficulty in \nrecovering damages for the vehicle. This outcome underscores the law's protective stance \ntowards minors, placing the onus on adult parties to exercise due diligence in contractual \ndealings with individuals whose capacity may be limited. \n \nCONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, based on the principles of contract law concerning minors/infants, Otondo, a \n13-year-old, is highly unlikely to be held contractually liable for the damage to the hired car. For \nIssue (1) and (2), the car hire agreement, being for recreational purposes (attending a party), does \nnot fall within the definition of \"necessaries.\" As such, the express term making the \"hirer liable \nfor damages\" is generally unenforceable against a minor, as contracts not for necessaries are \nvoidable at the minor's option under common law and rendered non-binding by statutes like the \nInfants Relief Act and equivalent Nigerian reception laws. Tomboy Car Hire Services' direct \nclaim against Otondo for the damage is therefore precarious, underscoring the legal protection \nafforded to minors from improvident agreements. \nFor Issue (3), where Otondo misrepresented his age as 25, the legal position, while seemingly \nmore complex, largely remains the same regarding direct contractual liability. While his \nfraudulent misrepresentation might preclude him from seeking specific equitable remedies, it \ndoes not, under established legal precedent (such as Leslie v. Sheill), transform an otherwise \nvoidable or unenforceable contract into a binding one. The law prioritizes the protection of \nminors, regardless of their deceit, preventing the contract from being enforced against them \ndirectly. Tomboy Car Hire Services would still face significant hurdles in enforcing the liability \nclause contractually against Otondo, even if he had lied about his age. \n20 \n \nUltimately, Tomboy Car Hire Services' failure to adequately verify Otondo's age prior to the \ntransaction places the primary risk and financial burden on them. This case serves as a stark \nreminder of the robust protection afforded to minors in contract law, highlighting the necessity \nfor commercial entities to implement stringent age verification procedures and understand the \nlimitations of enforcing contracts with underage individuals.\n \n21 \n \nREFERENCES \nI.E SAGAY, Nigerian Law of Contract, Third Edition (Revised), Spectrum Law Publishing \n(2018) \nInfants Relief Act by Legislation.gov.uk \nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/37-38/62 \n \nLIST OF CASES \n●​ Brown v.

It is one of the fundamental elements that determine the legitimacy of a \ncontract. Capacity is not presumed universally; rather, it is assessed based on specific \nqualifications such as age, mental soundness, and sobriety. \nThe importance of legal capacity in contract formation cannot be overstated. It serves as a \nsafeguard, protecting individuals and institutions from being unfairly bound to obligations they \nare not legally capable of understanding or fulfilling. Legal capacity is required so that people \nonly enter into contracts when they fully understand what they are doing and are in a fair \nposition to agree. This helps ensure that contracts are just and that the legal system treats \neveryone fairly. \nIn the Nigerian legal context, for a contract to be binding, all parties must be competent \nunder the law—meaning they must understand the nature and consequences of their actions. The \nabsence of capacity may render a contract void or voidable, depending on the circumstances \nsurrounding the agreement. Specifically, Section 4 of the Nigerian Contracts Act 1872- a statute \nof general application- provides that parties must be of majority age, of sound mind, and not \ndisqualified by any law to enter into a contract. \nSimilarly, under common law principles and judicial precedents such as Nash v. Inman \n(1908) and R v. Prince (1875), minors and intoxicated persons are afforded legal protections, \nallowing them to void contracts made without full mental competence. In Corpe v. Overton, \ncapacity to contract was defined as: \n“The legal ability of an individual to enter into a binding agreement, contingent upon \ntheir age, mental competence, and freedom from coercion.” \nThus, capacity to contract is both a foundational principle and a critical determinant of a \ncontract’s enforceability. A commonly accepted definition of a contract is \"an agreement that the \ncourts will enforce”. In other words, an agreement that is binding at law. However, even when all \nother ingredients of a valid contract are present, the contract may still be declared illegal, \nvoidable, or unenforceable if a defect- such as lack of capacity- is present. \nBeyond such defects, certain individuals are granted special legal status in contractual \ntransactions. This protective status aims to shield vulnerable persons- such as infants, mentally ill \n \nindividuals, intoxicated persons, and illiterates- from being exploited or defrauded during the \nprocess of entering contracts. \nJudicial precedents have further clarified this concept. In Labinjoh v. Abake, the court \nexamined the mental competence and age of the parties involved, emphasizing that individuals \nmust understand the nature and consequences of their contractual obligations. The case stands as \na critical reference in evaluating contractual capacity, especially for minors and individuals with \nmental impairments. In Corpe v. Overton, the court reinforced the principle that contracts \nentered into by minors are voidable at the minor’s discretion, thereby protecting young \nindividuals from exploitation. Likewise, in Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd, the House of Lords held that a \nperson suffering from a mental illness who cannot comprehend the nature of a contract lacks the \nlegal capacity to contract. \nIt is pertinent to note that capacity plays a cornerstone role in contract law, influencing \nthe validity, fairness, and legal integrity of agreements. It serves not only as a shield for \nvulnerable parties but also as a mechanism for promoting trust and certainty in contractual \nrelations. For example, in Labinjoh v. Abake, the court underscored the necessity for both parties \nto understand their rights and obligations, reaffirming that mutual understanding is central to \ncontract validity. \n \n2.APPLICATION TO HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO \nIn light of the legal principles governing contractual capacity, this essay addresses the \nlegal issues arising from a hypothetical scenario involving Akintunde, a 17-year-old engineering \nstudent, who purchased an iPhone from Alhaji Adamu, an agent of Express Telecommunication \nMerchandise, for the sum of Three Hundred Thousand Naira (₦300,000.00), under an \narrangement that he would pay in monthly installments of One Hundred Thousand Naira \n(₦100,000.00). Shortly after Akintunde left the store, Akinkola- who had just exited a bar after \nconsuming eight bottles of Star beer- entered the shop and bought a similar phone under the \nsame installment arrangement. As he was about to leave, Akinkola turned back and requested to \npurchase, on credit, an umbrella branded with the Apple logo, to protect himself from the heavy \ndownpour.By way of addition to the foregoing, this scenario presents a number of legal issues \nrelating to the capacity of parties to contract, particularly under Nigerian law and common law \nprinciples. \n \n2.1. Akintunde’s Legal Capacity as a Minor \nTherefore, Akintunde is not legally bound by the terms of the contract with Express \nTelecommunication via Alhaji Adamu if he chooses not to fulfill them, as he lacks the legal \ncapacity to contract under common law The first issues are whether a valid and enforceable \ncontract exists between Akintunde, a 17-year-old minor, and Alhaji Adamu, given that \nAkintunde is below the age of majority, and whether the goods purchased- particularly the \niPhone and umbrella- may be regarded as “necessaries” under the law. \nContracts involving minors are voidable at their own option. That is, such contracts are \nnot binding on the minor but are binding on the other party unless the minor repudiates the \ncontract after attaining the age of majority. The Infant Relief Act defines a minor as an \nindividual below the age of majority. Under common law, the age for entering into a valid \ncontractual agreement is 21 years, which has been judicially affirmed in the locus classicus case \nof Labinjoh v. Abake. In that case, the court held that while the age of majority under customary \nlaw is the age of puberty, the common law position is that a person must be 21 years old to have \nthe legal capacity to contract. Thus, the relevant legal principle for this case is the common law \nrequirement that a person must be 21 years old to enter into a binding contract. \nAkintunde’s agreement with Alhaji Adamu therefore fails to satisfy one of the essential \nelements of a valid contract—capacity—as he is a minor. Under common law, Akintunde lacks \nthe capacity to fully understand and evaluate the contract's terms and conditions. Upon attaining \nthe age of majority, Akintunde may either repudiate (refuse to be bound by) or ratify (formally \nconsent to) the contract. If he does not repudiate the contract within a reasonable time after \nreaching the age of majority, the contract may become binding on him.H  if the agreement \nbetween Akintunde and Express Telecommunication via Alhaji Adamu was made under \ncustomary law rather than common law, then Labinjoh v. Abake would still apply. Under \ncustomary law, the age of majority is the age of puberty, and Akintunde may be considered to \nhave the capacity to contract. \n \n \n2.2.1. Whether the iPhone is a Necessary \n \nOn the issue of whether the iPhone Akintunde bought is a necessary good: items \nclassified as necessary goods and beneficial services are binding on a minor. The Child Rights \nAct (2003) affirms this, and in Chapple v. Cooper, necessary goods are defined as: \n“Those without which an individual cannot reasonably exist.” \nBased on this definition, it can be inferred that the iPhone Akintunde purchased on credit \nis not a necessary good. It constitutes extravagant spending, and he could have chosen a less \nexpensive alternative, such as an Android phone. However, it cannot be conclusively stated that \npurchasing an iPhone is a lavish expenditure without considering Akintunde’s lifestyle. If he is \naccustomed to using luxury items regularly, it may be reasonable to deduce that the iPhone was a \nnecessary good for him. \n. The contract is thus voidable at his discretion. Nonetheless, given that general legal \nprinciples often have exceptions, the contract may still be enforceable if the iPhone is deemed a \nnecessary good \n3.2 Akinkola’s Intoxication and Legal Capacity \nThe second legal issue is whether the contract between Akinkola and Alhaji Adamu is \nvalid, considering that Akinkola was intoxicated at the time of entering the agreement, and \nwhether his request for an additional item- the Apple-branded umbrella- on credit constitutes a \nbinding contract in Nigerian law. \nIn Nigerian contract law, for a contract to be enforceable, as stated earlier, the parties \nshould have the legal capacity to contract—namely, the ability to comprehend the nature and \nimplications of the agreement. If a party is drunk, such a person may be deemed under the law to \nbe unable to give valid consent if the intoxication is so severe that they cannot understand the \ncontract. In Galluccio v. Gallo (1929), the court held that to cancel a contract on the grounds of \nintoxication, the intoxicated party must prove two things: \n●​ That they were so drunk that they did not know what they were doing. \n●​ That the other party knew (or should have known) that they were intoxicated. \nSimilarly, Chitty on Contracts (31st Edition) clarifies that a contract entered into by an \nintoxicated person is not void but voidable, provided that the level of drunkenness affects the \n \nparty’s ability to understand the contract. In Owoo v. Ani (1997) 6 NWLR (Pt. 509) 413, the \nNigerian courts affirmed that intoxication, like minority or mental incapacity, may render a \ncontract voidable. \nHere, Akinkola consumed eight bottles of Star beer and was reported to have staggered \ninto the shop. His drunkenness was evident and freely exhibited. Based on Galluccio v. Gallo, \nthis level of intoxication indicates he likely lacked the mental clarity to understand the nature and \nconsequences of purchasing an expensive phone on installment. Moreover, vendor Alhaji Adamu \nought to have observed Akinkola’s incapacitated state. The law imposes a duty on a merchant to \navoid contracting with a party whose incapacity can be reasonably perceived. Akinkola’s \nstaggering, probable slurred speech, and dazed behavior would have been clear signals to any \nreasonable person. \nEven further, Akinkola’s outlandish request to buy an Apple-branded umbrella on credit- \nsimply to shield himself from the rain- would serve as additional evidence of impaired judgment. \nIn Hart v. O’Connor [1985] AC 1000, the court held that a contract made with a person who is \nof unsound mind is voidable if the other party was aware of the incapacity. \nThus, the contract between Akinkola and Alhaji Adamu is likely voidable at Akinkola’s \ninstance on the following grounds: \n●​ He was so intoxicated that he lacked understanding of what he was doing. \n●​ Alhaji Adamu knew or ought to have known of his drunken condition. \nThe proposed purchase of the umbrella further proves the absence of rational capacity, \nmaking the transaction unenforceable. \n4.2 Vicarious Liability and Trademark Infringement \nA further issue that arises is whether either Alhaji Adamu or the principal, Express \nTelecommunication Merchandise, should bear liability if either of the contracts is breached. \nClosely related is the issue of trademark infringement, as the brand name of the umbrella was not \nclearly identified, yet it bore a logo resembling that of Apple Inc. \nLiability in contract law only arises where a valid and enforceable contract exists. \nAccording to Section 2 of the Sale of Goods Act: \n \n\"Where necessaries are sold and delivered to an infant or minor, or to a person who by \nreason of mental incapability or drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a \nreasonable price thereof.\" \nTherefore, if a contract is deemed invalid due to lack of capacity, enforceable obligations \nmay not arise- unless the goods are classified as necessaries. The doctrine of vicarious liability \nholds a principal accountable for the actions of their agent when those actions are carried out \nwithin the scope of their authority, including principal-agent or employer-employee \nrelationships. \nRegarding trademark infringement, Sections 5(2) and 29 of the Trademarks Act provide \nthat infringement occurs when a party uses a mark that is identical or confusingly similar to a \nregistered trademark in a way likely to deceive or cause confusion. Section 29 also grants the \nright to sue and outlines unauthorised uses, including the reproduction of protected logos without \nconsent. \nIn this scenario, it can be inferred that neither Akinkola (being intoxicated) nor \nAkintunde (being a minor) had full capacity to enter a binding contract. Consequently, the \ncontracts are voidable at their instance.Nb Express Telecommunication Merchandise (the \nprincipal) may bear contractual liability for the sale of the iPhones, as the transactions were \ncarried out within the scope of Alhaji Adamu’s authority. \nHowever, with respect to the Apple-branded umbrella, Alhaji Adamu may be personally \nliable. The umbrella does not fall within the category of goods typically sold by Express \nTelecommunication, nor does the transaction appear to have been authorised. Selling such an \nitem without Apple’s permission may also constitute trademark infringement, and since this act \nwas carried out outside the agent’s authority, liability would rest with Alhaji Adamu personally. \n \n \n \n3.Conclusion \n \nIn conclusion, both the agent and the principal may bear liability for the inconsistencies \narising from these transactions. The principal, Express Telecommunication Merchandise, would \nbe liable for the sale of the iPhones, as these transactions were conducted within the scope of the  \nagent’s authority. However, Alhaji Adamu may be personally liable for the sale of the \nApple-branded umbrella, since that transaction was outside his authority and may constitute \ntrademark infringement. \nMore broadly, the principle of capacity to contract is fundamental to ensuring fairness, \ninformed consent, and legal enforceability in Nigerian contract law. It safeguards individuals \nwho, due to age, intoxication, or mental incapacity, cannot fully comprehend the nature or \nconsequences of their contractual obligations. This legal protection, however, is not without \nexception. For instance, where a contract involves necessaries, or where the incapacitated party \nsubsequently ratifies the agreement, the contract may still be enforceable. \nApplying these principles to the facts, Akintunde’s status as a minor renders his contract \nvoidable at his discretion—unless the iPhone he purchased qualifies as a necessary, in which \ncase enforceability depends on both legal standards and his personal context. Similarly, \nAkinkola’s evident intoxication raises strong grounds for voidability, particularly as his erratic \nconduct suggested incapacity, and the vendor should have reasonably recognized this. \nBeyond the issue of individual capacity, the scenario implicates additional doctrines, \nnotably \nvicarious \nliability \nand \nintellectual \nproperty \nprotection. \nWhile \nExpress \nTelecommunication may be held vicariously liable for actions taken by its agent within the scope \nof \nhis \nauthority, \nAlhaji \nAdamu \nmay \nbear \npersonal \nliability \nfor \nunauthorized \ntransactions—particularly the sale of an umbrella bearing Apple’s logo, which may amount to \ntrademark infringement under Nigerian law. \nUltimately, this analysis reinforces that legal capacity is not a mere formality but a \nsubstantive safeguard. It promotes contractual justice by ensuring that parties enter agreements \nvoluntarily, knowledgeably, and within the limits of the law. When these thresholds are not met, \nthe law provides remedies not only to protect the vulnerable but to uphold the integrity of \ncontractual relationships. \nTable of Cases \n \n1.​ Bell v Lever Bros Ltd [1932] AC 161 (HL) \n2.​ Chapple v Cooper (1844) 13 M & W 252 \n3.​ Corpe v Overton (1833) 10 Bing 252, 131 ER 901 \n4.​ Galluccio v Gallo (1929) 240 NY 539 \n5.​ Hart v O’Connor [1985] AC 1000, [1985] 2 WLR 383, [1985] 1 All ER 880 (PC) \n6.​ Labinjoh v Abake (1924) 5 NLR 33 \n7.​ Nash v Inman [1908] 2 KB 1 \n8.​ Owoo v Ani (1997) 6 NWLR (Pt 509) 413 \n9.​ R v Prince (1875) LR 2 CCR 154 \n \nTable of Legislation \n1.​ Contracts Act 1872 (Nigeria) s 4 \n2.​ Infant Relief Act 1874 (UK) \n3.​ Child Rights Act 2003 (Nigeria) \n4.​ Sale of Goods Act 1893 (UK) s 2 \n5.​ Trademarks Act (Nigeria) ss 5(2), 29 \n \nBooks and Secondary Sources \n1.​ I.

Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \nBefore delving into the answer to the question, it is important to give a brief \nintroduction of what a contract is. In legal terms, not all agreements are contracts. For an \nagreement to be recognised and enforced by the courts, it must contain certain essential \nfeatures. A contract is more than a mere exchange of promise, it is a deliberate, lawful \narrangement that creates binding obligations between parties. Contract is generally defined as \nan agreement which the law will enforce or recognize as affecting the legal rights and duties \nof the parties. In the case of Kabo Air v. Tarfa1, Galadima J.C.A as he then was, held that a \ncontract must be an agreement which is legally binding on the parties to it and which if \nbroken, may be enforced by action in a court against the defaulting party. For a contract to be \nbinding, it must contain the five essential elements. These elements were well enunciated by \nthe court in the case of Guarantee Trust Bank Plc. v. Udoka Ayanwu2 where the court stated \nthat; \n“A contract is an agreement which the law will enforce or recognize as affecting the \nlegal rights and duties of the parties. A contract is also a promise or set of promises \nthe law will enforce. There are five ingredients that must be present in a valid \ncontract: offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relationship and \ncapacity to contract. All the five are autonomous and equal in the sense that a contract \ncannot be formed if any of them is absent. In other words, for a contract to exist in \nlaw, all the five ingredients must be present. For a contract to exist, there must be \nmutuality of purpose and intention; the two contracting parties must agree. One of the \nfundamental principles of the law of contract is that the parties must reach a \nconsensus ad idem in respect of the terms thereof, for the contract to be regarded as \nlegally binding and enforceable. The two or more minds must meet at the same point, \nevent or incident. Where they say different things at a different times, they are not ad \nidem and therefore no valid contract is formed. So the meeting of minds of the parties \nis the most crucial and overriding factor or determination in the law of contract.” \n​\nThis submission will explore the element of capacity through the lens of a contractual \ndispute involving Cristiano Ronaldo, a globally renowned footballer. Ronaldo entered into a \nlucrative contract with a Saudi Arabian football club, which was drafted exclusively in \n2 {2011} 46 WRN 159 at p. 173 \n1 {2004} 6 WRN 128 at 138 \nArabic. A dispute later arose over a restrictive clause that he allegedly misunderstood. This \nscenario raises important legal questions as to whether a valid and enforceable contract was \nformed, and whether the core elements required by law were truly present. This case tilts \nmore towards capacity to contract as an element of contract; thus, the next heading will speak \nabout capacity to contract. \n \n2. CAPACITY TO CONTRACT \n​\nThe capacity to contract has been said to be one of the five elements of a valid \ncontract, the other four being offer, acceptance, consideration and an intention to enter legal \nrelations. Where a party lacks the legal capacity to enter into a contract, such a contract may \nbe unenforceable against that party. In the law of contract, there are certain people the law \nseeks to protect. This protection is for people who, because of their circumstances, can easily \nbe exploited or defrauded in the making of bargains. These set of people include illiterates, \ninfants, lunatics and drunkards. Contracts involving these persons may either be void, \nvoidable or unenforceable against such party. A void contract is one that is invalid from the \nonset (void ab initio) and has no legal effect whatsoever, a voidable contract is one that is \nunenforceable against the party lacking capacity and upon attainment of capacity, can either \nbe ratified or repudiated. \n●​ Infants \nAccording to common law, the age of 21 years has been fixed as the age in which an \nindividual has absolute and unlimited legal capacity to contract. However, the United \nKingdom changed this position with the Family Law Reform Act 1969, which reduced the \nage of majority from 21 to 18. It was argued by some that the age of maturity has to do with \npersonal law and should be governed by customary law which is the age of puberty. The \ndebate was finally settled in the case of Labinjo v. Abake3 where the court decided that due to \nthe fact that the Infant Relief Act 1874 was a Statute of General Application, the age of \nmajority in Nigeria is 21 years. Thus, contract with an infant for loans, contracts for goods \n(apart from necessary goods) and account stated are absolutely void. Exceptions exist in \ncontracts for necessary goods and beneficial contracts of service where the contract is binding \n3 {1924} 5 N.L.R. 33 \non the infant. For example, in the case of Nash v. Inman4, the plaintiff was unable to enforce \nthe contract against the infant because it wasn’t relating to necessaries.  \n●​ Lunatics \nAs regards lunatics, contracts made by a lunatic can be classified into “contracts for \nnecessaries” and “contracts for other things”. Section 2 of the Sales of Goods Act \n1893 provides that where necessaries are sold and delivered to a person, who by \nreason of mental incapacity or drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a \nreasonable price therefore. ‘Necessaries’ means goods suitable to the condition in life \nof the person concerned and his usual requirements at the time of sale and delivery. \nWhere the goods are not necessary goods, the lunatic is bound by his contracts unless \nhe can show that i) owing to his mental condition, he did not understand what he was \ndoing and that ii) the other party was aware of his incapacity.  Where he is able to \nprove this, the effect is to make the contract voidable at his option. However, a \ncontract made by a lunatic during his lucid period is binding on him.  \n●​ Drunkards \nA person in a position of intoxication is in the same situation as a lunatic. If a \ndrunkard enters into a contract in a state of intoxication where he did not know what he was \ndoing and the other party is aware of the fact, the contract is voidable at his option. A \ndrunkard can ratify the contract when he becomes sober. With regards to necessary goods, as \nis provided in Section 2 of the Sales of Goods Act, the drunken person is obliged to pay a \nreasonable price for such goods sold and delivered to him.  \nThe question under consideration borders on the capacity of an illiterate, so further \nexplanation on it will be given subsequently. We will now delve into the solution to the \nproblem question above. \nThis case is about a contract between Ronaldo, a well-known footballer, and a Saudi \nArabian club. The contract was written in Arabic, which Ronaldo could not read or \nunderstand. He signed it based on the instruction of his agent. A clause in the contract limits \nhow many times he can travel out of Saudi Arabia in a year. Ronaldo broke this clause \nbecause he misunderstood it, and now the club wants to punish him by taking away part of \nhis allowance. This raises important questions under contract law about whether Ronaldo is \n4 {1908} 2 K.B. 1 \nbound by the contract he could not read, and whether the club’s action is right; that is, the \nclub forfeiting Ronaldo’s allowance because he travelled out of the country more than once in \na year, which is against what the written contract says .  \n \n3. ISSUES \n1) Whether or not Ronaldo is an illiterate. \n2) Whether or not Ronaldo is bound by the travel clause in the contract despite his lack of \nunderstanding of its Arabic contents. \n3) Whether or not Ronaldo’s reliance on his agent’s advice makes him bound and liable for \nbreach of contract  \n4) Whether or not the club can enforce the forfeiture of his monthly allowance. \n \n4. RULES \nRULE 1 \n​\nIt is a principle of law that parties to a contract must agree on all terms for a contract \nto be valid. This view was upheld in the case of Smith v. Hughes5, where the court held that a \ncontract is only enforceable where there is an agreement of all parties to the terms of the \ncontract. This also raises the pivotal issue of consensus ad idem (meeting of minds). It is also \na principle in law that consensus ad idem is a crucial and overriding factor in the formation of \na contract. In the case of Guarantee Trust Bank v. Udoka Ayanwu,6 the court stated that the \ntwo or more minds must meet at the same point, event or incidents, in the absence of this, no \nvalid contract is formed. It is also an established principle of law that parties to a contract are \nbound by the terms of the contract as seen in the case of A.G Rivers State v. A.G. Akwa Ibom \nState7 following the principle of “pacta sunt servanda”. However there are exceptions to this \nprinciple, there are some categories of people whom the law seeks to protect in order to \nprevent them from being exploited. One of such is an illiterate. We will now consider what \n7 {2011} 29 WRN 1 \n6 {2011} 46 WRN 159 at p. 173 \n5 {1871} LR 6 QB 597 \nqualifies a person to be termed an illiterate. Several judicial decisions have settled the law on \nwho an illiterate is. \n​\nIn P.Z & Co. Ltd. v. Gusau and Kantoma,8 the court took the view that “illiterate” \nmeant, illiterate in the language used in the document under consideration. It is irrelevant that \nthe defendant might be literate in some other language. The Illiterate Protection Act9 does \nnot supply any definition of the expression “illiterate person” in section 3, however an \nilliterate is considered to be anyone who is unable to read and understand the document in \nquestion in the language in which it is written. The judicial decision in Osefor v. Uwania,10 is \nalso worthy of note. It is a case in which the defendant/debtor claimed that he was not liable \nto repay a debt because he was an illiterate person and the plaintiff/creditor, had failed to \ncomply with section 3 of the Iliiterates Protection Act,  the court had to consider what \nconstituted illiteracy for the purpose of the act. An illiterate person according to Oputa J. as \nhe then was “…is a person who is unable to read with understanding, the document made or \nprepared on his behalf… Illiteracy is thus purely comparative. Thus, a graduate in English \nmay well be an illiterate in German”. This case underlines that the substance of illiteracy is \nnot merely about formal education but actual comprehension of the specific contractual \nlanguage. This definition was also upheld in the case of S.C.O.A. Zaria v. Okon,11 where the \ncourt held that a person may be sufficiently literate to sign his name and read figures, \nhowever, he may not be sufficiently literate to understand the meaning and effect of the \ndocument he is signing, and in such a case, the provisions of section 3 of the illiterates \nprotection act must be complied with.  \n​\nThus, by reason of these court decisions, we can conclude that an illiterate is someone \nwho does not understand the language in which a document which he signed is written, \nthough he may be literate in other languages.  \n \nRULE 2 \n​\nUnder the Nigerian Law of Contract, one of the most fundamental principles is that \ncontracts are generally binding on the parties that enter into them, once all the elements \n11 {1959} 4 FSC 220 at 223 \n10 {1971} 1 All NLR (ALR) 421 \n9 Labinjoh v. Abake 1924} 5 N.L.R. 33 \n8 {1961} N.R.N.L.R. 1 \nnecessary to create a valid agreement are present. However, the law recognizes that there are \nvulnerable classes of persons who may enter contracts without a full understanding of the \nimplications, and such individuals may require special legal protection. Among these are \nilliterate persons. ​\n \nIt is an established principle in law that an illiterate is not bound by the terms of a \ncontract if the document was not read and explained to him before he signed the contract. \nThis principle of law is well established in the case of Ezeigwe v. Awudu,12 where the \nSupreme court held that any agreement concluded with an illiterate person must contain the \nname, address of the writer and that prior to the document being signed by the illiterate \nperson, it must be read over and explained to him. Section 2 of the Illiterates Protection \nLaw also reiterates this position of law and it provides that any person who shall write any \nletter or document at the request, on behalf or in the name of an illiterate person shall also \nwrite on such letter or other document his own name as the writer thereof and his address; \nand his doing so shall be equivalent to a statement \na) that he was instructed to write such letter or document by the person for whom it purports \nto have been written and that the letter or document fully and correctly represents his \ninstructions; and  \nb) if the letter or document purports to be signed with the signature or mark of the illiterate \nperson, that prior to its being read over and explained to the illiterate person, and that the \nsignature or mark was made by such person. \nThis means there are some laid down procedures before a contract can be made with \nan illiterate person, which are; the contract must be read out to him in a language that he \nunderstands and that he understands the terms of the document before it is signed and that the \nwriter must also write his name and address on the document. Failure to comply with this \nprovision can render such a document unenforceable against the illiterate party. This principle \nwas echoed in S.C.O.A. Zaria v. Okon, where the Supreme Court emphasized that the object \nof the law is to protect illiterate persons from being defrauded. The court insisted that strict \ncompliance with the requirements of the law regarding illiteracy is mandatory, particularly \nconcerning the writer or interpreter of the contract. The underlying rationale is that the law \ncannot presume consent where comprehension is lacking. \n12 {2008} 5-6 SC (Pt. 11) 23 \n​\nThe case of Djukpan v. Orovuyovbe13 further supports this view by affirming that the \ninclusion of the name and address of the person who wrote or interpreted the document is not \na mere formality, but an essential element that allows the court to verify whether the illiterate \nparty was properly informed. Consequently, in the case where an illiterate signed a contract \nwritten in another language which he could not understand, and the document was not read \nover and explained to him in a language he understands, the contract will be unenforceable \nagainst the agent. The law presumes that there was no real consensus ad idem – no meeting of \nthe minds. If there is no evidence that the necessary procedural safeguards were followed \n(such as the use of an interpreter, or the presence of a jurat from the writer or explainer of the \ncontract), then the illiterate person may not be bound by the clause. In practice, courts will \nscrutinize the facts to determine whether the illiterate party understood what they were \nagreeing to. The courts may also consider whether the other party acted in good faith and \ntook reasonable steps to ensure understanding. But where the safeguards are absent and there \nis evidence of misunderstanding or deception, the laws are for the protection of the illiterate \nso the illiterate is not bound by the contract. \n \nRULE 3 \n​\nA central doctrine in contract law is that there must be a genuine agreement between \nthe parties, often described as a \"meeting of the minds\" (consensus ad idem). When a person \nrelies on an agent or third party to explain or interpret the terms of a contract, the \nenforceability of the agreement will depend on whether the party truly understood the \nobligations they were entering into. In Smith v. Hughes (1871), the English court established \nthat a contract is enforceable only where there is a clear mutual understanding between \nparties. In the Nigerian context, this principle interacts with the doctrines protecting illiterate \npersons and with agency law. If a party signs a contract written in a language they do not \nunderstand and does so solely on the advice or assurance of their agent without a proper \nexplanation of the terms, then the party may have a valid defence against the enforcement of \nsuch contract. This is particularly relevant where the contract turns out to have adverse \nconsequences that were not explained to them.  \n13 {1967} LCN/1487 (SC) \nThe relevance of Foster v. Mackinnon (1869)14 is also instructive. In that case, an \nelderly man signed a document under the mistaken belief that it was something different from \nwhat it actually was. The court held that he was not bound by it, since the document had not \nbeen properly explained to him. By analogy, a party who signs a contract based solely on an \nagent's instruction, without understanding the nature of the document, may not be bound \nwhere it is shown that the document was materially different from what was believed. In \nNigerian law, the responsibility to ensure understanding lies especially heavily on the party \nseeking to enforce the contract. Where the signer is an illiterate or a person who does not \nunderstand the language of the contract, the burden is on the other party (or the agent) to \nensure the contents were accurately explained. Failure to do so would result in the contract \nbeing unenforceable against the uninformed party. In practical terms, this means that reliance \non an agent's advice does not automatically exonerate a party from contractual obligations.  \nThe key question is whether the party fully understood the implications of the \nagreement. The law will not protect wilful ignorance, but it also does not reward negligent \nmisrepresentation or failure to communicate critical details. To summarize, a party who \nenters a contract based solely on an agent’s guidance may not be completely free of liability, \nbut may successfully argue that the contract is not enforceable if there was no genuine \nmeeting of the minds due to misunderstanding. In situations where illiteracy or language \nbarriers exist, the courts are inclined to protect the uninformed party where procedural \nsafeguards and explanations were absent. \n \nRULE 4 \nIt is a principle in law that a contract cannot be enforced by the writer if it is \nestablished that the other party is an illiterate and the contract was not explained to him \nbefore he signed the contract. The case of Osefo v. Uwania, reiterates this principle. In this \ncase, Oputa J (as he then was) declared that “if a document which does not comply with the \nIlliterates Protection Act creates legal rights and the writer benefits therefrom, those \nbenefits are unenforceable by the writer against the illiterate.” The Illiterates Protection Act \nand similar enactments were passed for the protection of a particular class of persons, viz, \nilliterate persons. There are four possible effects of non-compliance. It could make the \n14 {1869} LR 4 CP 704 \ncontract illegal, void, voidable or unenforceable. In the first place, although not declaring the \ncontracts void, the courts have held consistently that they are not enforceable at the instance \nof the ‘writer’. In Agbara v. Amara,15 Edozie J.C.A held that; unenforceability is restricted \nto the writer of the document to prevent him from taking a benefit from the document at the \ndetriment of the illiterate.” This position of law is to prevent the illiterate person from being \ndefrauded.  \n​\nIt is also an established principle of law that there must be consensus ad idem \n(meeting of minds) before a contract can be valid. The case of Smith v. Hughes reiterates \nthis position. Thus, clearly the mind of an illiterate person and that of the writer did not meet \nin the formation of the contract, thus the contract is rendered unenforceable by the writer. The \nprinciple of “non est factum” which means it is not my deed is also used by an illiterate \nperson to say that he did not intend what he actually signed due to the fact that he did not \nunderstand the terms and it was not explained to him by the writer.  \n \n5. APPLICATION \nAPPLICATION 1 \nBy reason of court decisions such as P.Z & Co. Ltd. v. Gusau and Kantoma, inter \nalia, it has been established that an illiterate person is someone who does not understand the \nlanguage in which a contract is written, though he may be literate in other languages. It must \nalso be proven that he did not intend or understand the implication of what he is signing \nbecause it was not read out and explained to him. Ronaldo in this question does not \nunderstand Arabic language which is the language in which the contract was written. In the \nevent that it is successfully proven that the procedural rules guiding contracting with an \nilliterate which are that the writer must have written his name and address on the document, \nand that the Saudi Arabian club must have read out and explained the document to Ronaldo \nin the language that he understands were not abided by, then Ronaldo can be considered an \nilliterate in this contract. \n \n \n15 {1995} 7 NWLR (pt. 410) 712 \nAPPLICATION 2 \nAccording to Section 2 of the Illiteracy protection Act and in judicial decisions such \nas S.C.O.A. Zaria v. Okon and Ezeigwe v. Awudu, where a contract is made with an illiterate, \nthe writer must write his name and address on the document and ensure that prior to the \ndocument being signed by the illiterate person, it was read over and explained to him, and \nthat the signature or mark was in fact made by the illiterate person. In a situation where these \nrules are not followed, the illiterate is not bound by the contract. In Ronaldo’s case once it is \nsuccessfully proven that these procedures were not followed by the Saudi Arabian club, then \nRonaldo is considered not to be bound by the contract under the doctrine of non est factum. \n \nAPPLICATION 3 \n​\nIn line with the established principle in the law of contract that for a valid contract to \nbe formed, there must be consensus ad idem (the meeting of minds) on all the terms and \nclauses in the contract as seen in the case of Smith v. Hughes. As can also be seen in the case \nof Lawal v. G.B Oliviant Ltd., where the court said a man may be an illiterate but understand \nthe purport and consequences of the document he is signing after it has been explained to \nhim, in this case Ronaldo is still an illiterate even though he signed it on the instruction of his \nagent, because he did not understand the purport or consequences of the document and the \nclause restricting travel. So, in this case, even though Ronaldo signed the document on the \ninstruction of his agent, it can still be argued that since there was no proper explanation of the \nterms and clauses in the contract, there was no consensus ad idem and therefore the clause is \nunenforceable in line non-compliance with the provision of Section 2 of the Illiterates \nProtection Act. While the agent acted within the scope of his authority, Ronaldo’s inability to \nunderstand the contract coupled with the lack of explanation, renders the contract \nunenforceable because there was no consensus ad idem. \n \nAPPLICATION 4 \nUpon successful proof that the procedures in Section 3 of the illiterates protection act \nwere not followed, the club cannot enforce the sanctions. As has been duly stated in the \nilliterates’ protection act and judicial decisions such as Agbara v. Amara and Osefo v. \nUwania, the laws are for the protection of the illiterate and the contracts are unenforceable at \nthe instance of the writer to prevent him from taking advantage of the illiterate.  \n \n6. CONCLUSION. \nIn conclusion, I will advise Ronaldo to sue the Saudi Arabian company as they cannot \nenforce the sanction of the forfeiture of one week allowance because he is protected by the \nfact that he is an illiterate and does not have capacity to enter into such contract so the club \ncannot enforce the punishments against him. He should sue and plead for prohibitory \ninjunction restraining the company from enforcing the forfeiture of the allowance. I will also \nadvice Ronaldo to query his agent for not performing due diligence before instructing \nRonaldo to sign the contract. \nI will advise the Saudi Arabian to pull back from enforcing the forfeiture of Ronaldo’s  \nweekly salary as is seen in the clause because Ronaldo is illiterate of the clause and they did \nnot perform their role under Section 3 of the Illiteracy Protection Act.", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 15.pdf"}
{"text": "QUESTION: “Put simply, a stranger to a contract cannot gain or be bound by it even if made for \nhis benefits.” Per Ogbuinya, JCA in Multichoice Nigeria Ltd. v MCSM Ltd./ GTE [2020] All \nFWLR pt.1063 p.  733 at 860; paras. A-C. \nIn view of the above assertion, discuss the doctrine Privity of Of Contract And The \nexceptions thereto. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe doctrine of  Privity of Contract is a foundational principle in contract law, asserting that only \nparties to a contract can enforce or be bound by its terms. This rule, rooted in English common \nlaw, has shaped the contractual frameworks of many common law jurisdictions, including \nNigeria. Its central aim is to uphold the sanctity of contract by ensuring that legal obligations and \nbenefits are confined to those who voluntarily enter into the agreement. The principle was firmly \nestablished in Tweddle v. Atkinson where the court denied a third party the right to sue despite \nthe contract being made for his benefit. It was further reinforced in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co \nLtd v. Selfridge & Co Ltd where Lord Haldane LC emphasized that only a person who is a \nparty to a contract can be sued on it. These decisions underscore the traditional rigidity of the \nprivity rule. \n \nIn Nigeria, this stance was recently affirmed in Multichoice Nigeria Ltd. v. MCSN Ltd./GTE \nwhere Ogbuinya, JCA, stated: “Put simply, a stranger to a contract cannot gain or be bound by \nit even if made for his benefits.” The case illustrates how Nigerian courts continue to uphold the \ncore logic of privity. However, while the doctrine promotes legal clarity, its strict application has \nattracted criticism for producing outcomes that may seem inequitable, especially where a \ncontract is clearly intended to benefit a third party. Over time, both courts and legislatures have \nrecognized the need for flexibility by carving out a number of exceptions to address such \nscenarios and balance fairness with legal certainty. \n \nThis paper will examine the origins and rationale of the privity doctrine,the General rules and \napplications, its judicial interpretation and practical implications, and the statutory and common \nlaw exceptions that have evolved, particularly within the Nigerian legal framework. \n \nGENERAL RULE OF PRIVITY OF CONTRACT  \n \nThe doctrine of privity of contract holds that only those who are party to a contract can sue or be \nsued upon it. The core of the doctrine lies in two essential principles which are: \n1. No burden without consent : a person should not be burdened by obligations to which they \nhave not agreed.  \n2. No benefit without consideration : a person who has not furnished consideration should not \nderive benefit enforceable in law. \n \nLord Denning in the case of Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd [1962] AC 446 stated the \ngeneral rule of privity of contract thus; \n    “There is no magic in the words 'contractual rights.' If a third party has been so closely and \ndirectly affected by the contract, and it was intended to benefit him, the law should recognize his \nright.” \n \nLord Haldane LC in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v. Selfridge & Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 \nstated the general rule of contract as that;  \n\"Only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on it.\" \n \nLord Denman in the case of Price v Easton (1833) 4 B & Ad 433 noted that:  \n“No promise can be implied to a person with whom the defendant did not contract.” \n \nPats-Acholonu JCA in the case of Nwadukwe v. Uzoka (2002) 12 NWLR (Pt. 780) 139 at 161 \nexpressed that: \n “The law is settled that only parties to a contract can sue and be sued on it. A contract cannot \nbe enforced by or against a person who is not a party to it.” \n \nThe rationale behind the privity rule is grounded in fundamental contract theory of : \n(a)Autonomy: Individuals should be free to determine their legal obligations. \n(b)Clarity and Predictability: It ensures that legal liability is predictable and confined to those \nwho have bargained for it. \n(c)Consideration: This principle complements the doctrine of consideration, which requires \nmutual exchange of value. \nThese justifications aim to protect contractual integrity by preventing an overflow of litigation \nfrom non-parties who neither bargained for nor gave anything in exchange. \n \nThe strict application of privity of contract as seen in Right of Action and The Rule of \nConsideration goes thus: \n \n RIGHT OF ACTION \nThe Right of Action refers to the legal right a party has to initiate a lawsuit in court when a \nbreach of the contract takes place. It also involves the legal protection a person is entitled to such \nthat he can seek a remedy to atone for the wrong done. This doctrine of privity was firmly \nestablished in the nineteenth century where Lord Haldane held in the case cited earlier (Dunlop \nPneumatic Tyre Ltd v. Selfridge Ltd) early that Dunlop could not sue Selfridge for breach \nbecause he was not the dealer who sold to him. Hence, he is not a party to the contract. It was \nalso held in the case of Chuba Ikpeazu v. African Continental Bank that the bank could not \nsue the appellant because it was not a party to the contract and therefore could not enjoy the right \nof action.  \n \n           \nAlso in Etco(Nig.) Ltd. v. Western Nigerian Development Corporation (WNDC), the Court \nheld that the plaintiffs could not sue the defendant on the grounds that there were no parties to \nthe contract. On this Agbaje J. stated that when a person negotiates a contract as agent between \nthe principal and the third party, the contract comes into existence only between the principal and \nthe third party. Thus, the agent has no right to sue on it. We also need to note that a  person who \nis not a party to a contract can not only enforce action to it but is also not liable to any duty. This \nis why the Court ruled out the  Governor's suit in Ilesa Local Planning Authority (LPA) v. \nOlayide. It was said that although the respondent was a party to a contract of employment, the \nother party to it was the government of Oyo State and not the appellant's Authority. Nevertheless, \nin a situation where the plaintiff is a member of the organisation, who is a party to the contract, \nhe can sue in representative capacity.  That is he is in the position of the organisation and not in \nhis name.       \n            \n \nRULE OF CONSIDERATION \nAsides in contracts under seal, a party needs to furnish consideration before he/she can be \ngranted the right to sue on it.  \nWhat then is Consideration ? \nConsideration here means something the law views as valuable. It could be a right, a profit, \nbenefit or even detriment or forbearance a party undergoes. This element is key in simple \ncontracts because without consideration, the law does not consider a person, a party to a contract \non which he can exercise this right to action. This is why the Court of Appeal reiterated the \nprinciple in the case of  Ladimeji v. Federal Ministry of Works and Housing that a contract \nbinds only the parties to it and cannot be enforced on persons who are not parties to it even if the \ncontract was made for the benefit of the external party. This is because the party has not \nfurnished consideration.  \n \nThe rule emphasizes the mutual exchange of something for another in order for the contract to be \nbinding  and this is what gives the parties involved the right to initiate action once breach occurs. \nThe rule plays in Eastwood v. Kenyon where Eastwood, a guardian to Mrs. Kenyon took care of \nher till maturity. Mrs. Kenyon then promised to reimburse him for the expenses he incurred, but \nshe did not fulfill the promise. Eastwood’s suit was dismissed on the grounds that a moral \nobligation to train a child is not considered. This is a duty expected of him as her guardian hence \nthere was no contract at all. It is the duty of the Law to determine what is sufficient enough to be \naccepted as consideration. \nBy the general principle of contract, a contract cannot be enforced by a person who is not a party \neven if the contract is made for his benefit. Only parties to a contract can enforce it. A person \nwho is not part of a contract does not have the enforceable right. \n On the authority of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd V. Selfridge, only a party who provided \nconsideration can sue. A third party to a contract even if mentioned cannot enforce it unless they \nare a party. Confirming the doctrine of privity, the supreme Court in Ogunyade V. Oshunkeye \nupheld that only parties to a contract can sue or be sued on it.  \n \n \nEXCEPTIONS TO PRIVITY OF CONTRACT \n \nThe general rule of privity of contract maintains that only parties to a contract can sue or be sued \nunder it. However, to prevent injustice and reflect commercial realities, courts have recognized \nexceptions to this rule. The exceptions which would be examined subsequently are (a) Right of \nAction (b) Rule of Consideration (c) Specific Performance (d) Damages (e) \n \n \nSPECIFIC PERFORMANCE  \n \nSpecific performance is an equitable remedy that compels a party to perform their contractual \nobligations, rather than merely paying damages for breach. This remedy is most commonly used \nwhen damages would be inadequate, such as in contracts for the sale of land or unique goods. \n \nUnder privity of contract, only parties to the contract may seek specific performance. This means \nthat a third party, even if a contract is made for their benefit, generally cannot sue for specific \nperformance unless they fall within an exception to privity (e.g., trust of a promise, collateral \ncontract, or statutory provisions). \nIn Beswick V. Berwick, Peter transferred his coal delivery business to John Beswrick upon a \npromise by John to pay money to Peter and his wife for life. The contract was made only \nbetween Peter and John without the wife being involved. When Peter died, John refused to make \nthe promised payment to Peter's wife. She went to court in the capacity of (i) an administrator of \nPeter's estate and (ii) in her personal capacity. The gourmet referred to the earlier decisions like \nRobertson v. Wait  (1853) and Lloyd's v. Harper (1880) which established that when a contract \nis made with one party (X) for the benefit of another (Y), X can bring an action for the benefit of \nY and recover all dues as if the contract was made with Y. The contracting party may, either \nalone or with the third party beneficiary, have the contract performed by a way of court order or \nspecific performance. Accordingly, the court upheld Mrs Beswick's claim in her capacity as the \nestate administrator succeeded and court ordered John to pay and continue the payment. \n \nHowever, her personal claim was denied due to the doctrine of privity which bars enforcement of \na contract by someone who is not a party to it. Also, the court clarified that the contracting party \nenforcing the contract on behalf of the third party cannot personally retain the money and must \nhold it for the third person. Accordingly, although Mrs Beswick acted in a representative \ncapacity, the received funds were for her personal benefit.  \n \n \nSTAY OF PROCEEDING  \n \nStay of proceeding is a remedy which is applicable in a situation where a contract provides for a \ncovenant to not sue the third party. It is used when someone sues in violation of a previous \nagreement not to do so. \nFor example, if two parties A and B sign a contract saying they won't sue a third party, and one \nof them breaks that agreement and starts a lawsuit, the other contracting party can ask the court \nto stay or stop the case from going forward.  This remedy was relevant in Snelling v. John G. \nSnelling Ltd. In this case, three brothers agreed that they would forfeit their debt owed to them \nby the company if they resign. One of them resigned and sued the company to recover the \nmoney. The question, thus, arose whether one of the brothers could  sue the company for \nrecovery of debt, notwithstanding the agreement of forfeiture.  The company along with the other \ntwo brothers (by way of counterclaim) sought to invoke the agreement so as to stay the legal \naction, and/or dismiss the recovery claim. \n \nBefore a stay can be granted, there are conditions.  \n(i) The contract must clearly provide for an undertaking that the promisor has agreed not to sue \nthe third party. \n(ii) The promisee must have real interest in enforcing such a promise. \n \n \nDAMAGES \n \nDamages are the primary remedy for breach of contract, intended to place the injured party in the \nposition they would have occupied had the contract been properly performed. However, the \nprivity doctrine limits this right to the parties to the contract. \n \nIn the classic English case of Tweddle v. Atkinson, the plaintiff, although a beneficiary of the \ncontract, was unable to enforce it because he was not a party to the agreement between his father \nand father-in-law. Similarly, in Beswick v. Beswick, the House of Lords held that a widow could \nnot personally enforce an agreement made between her late husband and his nephew. \nNevertheless, she succeeded in her claim when she sued in her capacity as the administrator of \nher husband’s estate, illustrating how procedural mechanisms can sometimes bypass the rigidity \nof privity to serve justice. \nThis case demonstrates the courts' willingness, in appropriate circumstances, to mitigate the \nharsh consequences of privity in the interest of fairness. \n \n \nINJUNCTION \n \nAn injunction is an equitable remedy in the form of a court order that either restrains a party \nfrom breaching a contract or compels specific performance. The ability to seek such relief is \ngenerally confined to the parties to the contract. \nThis principle was affirmed in Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v. Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd, \nwhere a third party could not seek an injunction or enforce the contract because they were not \none of its original parties. \nNonetheless, courts have occasionally adopted legal constructs to circumvent privity. For \ninstance, in some cases, a contract has been construed as creating a trust for the benefit of a third \nparty, or a collateral contract has been implied between a party and a third-party beneficiary. In \nthe Nigerian legal context, statutory interventions have also provided exceptions. \n Notably, Section 81(1) of the Property and Conveyancing Law empowers certain third \nparties, particularly those with interests in land transactions, to enforce contractual rights even in \nthe absence of direct privity. \n  \nSTATUTES  \n \nSome of the statutes are the following: \n \nCarriage of Goods by Sea Act (1992)  applicable in Nigeria and Uk.  This gives third party \nConsignees rights under the bill of laden.   \nA consignee is a person to whom goods are shipped and who is intended to receive them, \nespecially a bill of laden (a document used in transportation of goods). \n \nUnder the doctrine of privity of contract, a consignee may not be a party to the contract between \na Consignor and the Carrier. However, this statute grants an exception to the Consignee who is a \nthird party (a stranger). \n \nMotor vehicle (Third Party Insurance) Act 1990 gives right to Third Parties to bring claims \nagainst insurance companies, although they are not parties to the Insurance Contract. \nThe case of  Vandepitte V. Preferred Accident Insurance Corp (1933),  a Canadian case that \nallowed a third party beneficiary to claim under an insurance policy on the basis of trust \nprinciple. \n \nConsumer Protection laws. \nVarious Consumer Protection statutes might also allow consumers to have rights against \nmanufacturers or suppliers even when they did not purchase the product directly under contract, \nsuch as warranty rights or product liability laws. \nContract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 UK: The statute allows a third party to enforce a \ncontract if the contract expressly allows it or if the contract purports to confer a benefit on them. \n \n \nTRUST  \n \nTrust is a well recognized exception to the general rule in Privity of Contract. \nWhen a Party called a Trustee enters into a contract intended to benefit a third party (the \nbeneficiary), the law may construe a trust in favour of that third party.  In such cases, the third \nparty, though not a signatory to the contract, may be allowed to enforce it in equity.  The \ncontracting party (Trustee), is seen as holding the benefit of the contract in Trust for the Third \nparty. \nIn the case of  Dutton V. Poole (1678) \nThe court enforced a promise made by a father to his son for the benefit of his sister.  This is one \nof the earliest Trust based exceptions to Privity of Contract \n \n \nCOLLATERAL CONTRACT:  \n \nA collateral contract is a separate and independent agreement that coexists with a principal \ncontract. It arises where a party (A) makes a representation to another (B) which induces B to \nenter into a contract with a third party (C). Although B and A are not parties to the main contract, \nthe law may treat the initial assurance as a binding promise enforceable in its own right thereby \ncreating enforceable rights for a non-party. \n \nTo establish a valid collateral contract, the following must be proven: \n(I)Clear representation or assurance \n(ii)Intention to create legal relations \n(iii)Inducement (the representation must have caused the other party to enter the main contract) \n    \nIn Shanklin Pier Ltd v. Detel Products Ltd (1951) 2 KB 854, the court held that a collateral \ncontract existed between Shanklin Pier and Detel, even though they had no direct contractual \nrelationship. Detel’s assurance about the durability of its paint induced Shanklin Pier to instruct \npainters to use it. This assurance was enforceable as a collateral contract. \n \nThe Court in the English case of  Wells (Merstham) Ltd v. Buckland Sand and Silica Co Ltd \n[1965] 2 QB 170, reaffirmed that representations forming part of pre-contractual negotiations \ncan become binding warranties enforceable independently. \n \nNigerian Perspective \nWhile Nigerian jurisprudence does not frequently litigate collateral contracts, the doctrine is \nrecognized under received English law. In Niger Insurance Co. Ltd v. Abed Brothers Ltd \n[1976] 6 SC 35, the Supreme Court demonstrated a willingness to consider representations made \noutside the main agreement. \n \nIn Scoa Nigeria Ltd v. Sterling Bank Plc [2016] LPELR-40108(CA), the Court of Appeal \nexplored whether representations made to induce reliance could form enforceable rights. While \nno collateral contract was found, the case confirmed Nigerian courts' openness to the doctrine. \n \n Collateral contracts provide a flexible legal tool that mitigates the rigidity of privity. They are \nespecially useful in commercial transactions involving multiple parties or reliance on \nrepresentations made by non-contracting entities. While more developed in English law, the \ndoctrine remains applicable in Nigeria, ensuring fairness and justice in layered contractual \nrelationships. \n \n \n \nASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS \n      \nWhile the doctrine of privity restricts the enforceability of contractual obligations and benefits to \nthe original parties , the doctrine of assignment allows a third party (the assignee) to step into the \nshoes of a party (the assignor) and enforce contractual rights, even without being part of the \noriginal agreement. This constitutes a significant exception to the privity rule. \n \nNature of Assignment \n     \nAssignment is the legal transfer of contractual rights from one party to another. The assignor \ntransfers the benefits (but not necessarily obligations) of a contract to the assignee. Upon valid \nassignment, the assignee gains the right to enforce the contract against the other party (the \nobligor). \n \nWhat differentiate an assignment from novation is that while assignment involves transfer of \nrights alone, novation is a complete substitution of one party by another, involving all parties' \nconsent. It creates a new contract and transfers both rights and obligations. \nUnder Nigerian law Section 81(1) of the Property and Conveyancing Law (Western Nigeria) \nallows third parties to enforce rights made for their benefit. \nEquitable principles and English common law, received into Nigerian jurisprudence, also support \nassignment. \n     \nIn Ajayi v. Total Nigeria Plc [2013] LPELR-20898(CA), the Nigerian Court of Appeal upheld \nthe right of an assignee to enforce a contract, emphasizing the need to prove the existence and \nvalidity of the assignment. \n \nIn Interdrill Nigeria Ltd v. UBA Plc [2017] LPELR-41907(SC), the Supreme Court \ndistinguished assignment from novation and clarified that novation requires mutual agreement \namong all parties and creates a fresh contract. \n \nIn Tolhurst v. Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd [1902] 2 KB 660, the English \ncourt held that an assignee of a commercial supply contract had standing to enforce it, even \nthough not a party to the original contract. \n \nTransfer of rights by assignment is widely used in: \n(i)Banking and finance (debt assignments, loan sales) \n(ii)Insurance (beneficiaries of life insurance) \n(iii)Real estate (lease transfers), \n(iv)Intellectual property (licensing and rights transfers). \n     \nAssignment offers a practical and legally recognized way to bypass the constraints of privity in \nmodern commerce. Nigerian courts, guided by statutory and common law principles, recognize \nthis exception, promoting flexibility, efficiency, and fairness in contractual dealings. \n \n \nRESTRICTIVE COVENANTS ON LAND \n     \nRestrictive covenants are private agreements between landowners that restrict the use or \ndevelopment of one piece of land (the \"burdened land\") for the benefit of another piece of land \n(the \"benefited land\"). They are a form of private planning control and are typically embedded in \nthe title deeds of a property or a separate declaration. Simply put they are covenants  imposing a \nrestriction on the use of land so that the value and enjoyment of adjoining land will be preserved. \na covenant imposing a restriction on the use of land so that the value \nand enjoyment of adjoining land will be preserved.  \n \nNature of Restrictive Covenants on Land: \n     \nNegative in nature: They generally prevent a landowner from doing something, rather than \nrequiring them to do something (e.g., \"not to build above two stories,\" \"not to use the land for \ncommercial purposes\"). Positive covenants, which require an active action or expenditure, \ngenerally do not \"run with the land\" as easily, meaning they may not bind subsequent owners.  \n     \nRun with the land: This is a crucial aspect. Once properly established, restrictive covenants \nbind not just the original parties who agreed to them, but also subsequent owners of the burdened \nland, regardless of whether they were aware of the covenant at the time of purchase (though \nproper registration is often required for enforceability).  \n     \nPurpose: They are typically put in place to preserve the value, character, and enjoyment of \nadjoining or nearby land. For example, a developer might impose restrictive covenants on a new \nhousing estate to ensure a consistent appearance or to prevent commercial activities.  \n \n \nEnforceability of Restrictive Covenants  \nBeneficiary:  \n      \nThe person or entity who owns the \"benefited land\" can enforce the covenant. This could be a \nneighbouring landowner, a property developer, or an estate management company. \n If a restrictive covenant is breached, the beneficiary can seek legal action, which may include: \nInjunction (A court order forcing the breaching party to stop the offending activity or undo \nunauthorized changes), \nDamages: Monetary compensation for any financial loss caused by the breach (e.g., reduction in \nproperty value). \nNegotiation/Release: In some cases, the parties may negotiate to release or modify the covenant, \noften in exchange for a financial payment. \nDischarge/Modification: Restrictive covenants can be discharged or modified under certain \ncircumstances, such as if they become obsolete, impede reasonable use of the land, or by mutual \nagreement. \n     \nThe Nigerian law generally recognizes and enforces restrictive covenants, particularly if they \n\"touch and concern\" an identifiable land and there was an intention for the benefit to run with the \nland. However, enforceability can be subject to considerations of reasonableness and public \npolicy, especially in the context of agreements that could be seen as \"restraint of trade.\" The \nFederal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) in Nigeria also has provisions \nthat may affect the enforceability of certain restrictive covenants, particularly if they are \nanti-competitive or exceed a specified duration (e.g., two years).  \n \n \nNEGLIGENCE IN LAND OWNERSHIP AND TRANSACTIONS \n      \nNegligence in a legal context refers to the failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably \nprudent person would have exercised in the same circumstances, resulting in harm or damage to \nanother. In the context of land, negligence can arise in various scenarios: \n1. Property Owner Negligence (Premises Liability) \na. Duty of Care: Property owners have a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining their \nproperty to ensure it is safe for lawful visitors. This duty generally extends to preventing \nforeseeable harm. \nb. Breach of Duty: This occurs when the property owner fails to meet that standard of care. \nExamples include: \nc. Failing to maintain safe premises (e.g., uneven sidewalks, inadequate lighting, structural \ndefects). \nd. Not warning visitors about known hazards. \ne. Violating building codes or safety regulations. \nf. Causation: The property owner's breach of duty must be a direct cause of the injury or damage \nsuffered by another person. \ng. Damages: The injured party must have suffered actual harm (e.g., medical expenses, lost \nwages, pain and suffering). \nCommon examples include slip and fall accidents, injuries from poorly maintained structures, \ninadequate security leading to crime. \n \n2. Negligence in Real Estate Transactions: \na. Real estate agents/brokers: These professionals owe a duty of care and often a fiduciary duty \nto their clients (buyers or sellers). Negligence can occur when they fail to meet professional \nstandards, causing harm to their clients. Examples include: \nb. Misrepresentation: Providing false or misleading information about a property, even if \nunintentional, if they lacked reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. \nc. Failure to disclose: Not informing a buyer about known material defects in a property (e.g., \nstructural issues, mold, pest infestations). \nd. Inadequate due diligence: Failing to properly investigate property details or verify essential \ndocuments. \ne. Breach of fiduciary duty: Putting their own interests or those of another party before their \nclient's. \nf. Mishandling client funds or information. \nOther parties such as Lawyers, surveyors, and other professionals involved in real estate \ntransactions also owe a duty of care to their clients. Their negligence (e.g., providing incorrect \nlegal advice, conducting a faulty survey) can lead to significant financial losses and legal \ndisputes.  \n \nElements of a Negligence Claim (General):  \n       \nTo successfully sue for negligence, the claimant typically needs to prove four elements: \n1. Duty of Care: The defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff. \n2. Breach of Duty: The defendant breached that duty by acting or failing to act in a way that a \nreasonable person would not have. \n3. Causation: The defendant's breach directly caused the plaintiff's injury or damage. \n4. Damages: The plaintiff suffered actual damages as a result of the injury.  \n \n \nSALE OF FAMILY LAND IN CUSTOMARY LAW \n        \nUnder customary law, family land is not the personal property of any one individual but is owned \ncommunally by all members of the family  both past, present, and even future generations. \nBecause of this, when a family head or any member sells family land without the consent of the \nprincipal family members, those members can go to court to challenge or set aside the sale, even \nif they were not direct parties to the sale agreement. \nThis is a recognized exception to the doctrine of privity. In cases like Lewis v. Bankole (1908) 1 \nNLR 81 and Agaran v. Olushi (1907) 1 NLR 66, it was established that members of a family \nhave the right to bring an action to set aside a conveyance of family land that was done without \ntheir consent. In Adejumo v. Ayantegbe [1989] 3 NWLR (Pt.110) 417, Justice Karibi-Whyte \nexplained the reason thus: “family land under customary law is communal, so every family \nmember is essentially a co-owner and not a stranger to any transaction involving the land. \nBecause of that communal ownership, it doesn’t matter if a family member wasn’t directly \ninvolved in the sale, they still have a legal right to challenge it”. \nFor example, if an uncle secretly sells family land to an outsider without telling the main family \nmembers, any principal member of the family can file a suit to nullify that sale. The buyer cannot \nrely on privity to argue that the other family members have no right to challenge the contract. \n \n \nCONTRACTS FOR THE HIRE OF A CHATTEL \n      \nAnother important exception appears in contracts involving the hire of chattels  especially in \nshipping, with charter party agreements. The classic case is De Mattos v. Gibson (1858) De G. \n& J. 276. Here, A chartered his ship to B. During the period of the charter, A mortgaged the ship \nto C. C knew about the existing charterparty but still tried to use or dispose of the ship in a way \nthat conflicted with B’s rights. The court held that because C acquired the ship with knowledge \nof the earlier contract, he could be restrained from using the ship inconsistently with the \ncharterparty, even though C wasn’t a party to the charter. \n \nKnight Bruce LJ, in De Mattos v. Gibson, stated that when someone acquires property \nknowing it is already subject to a contract with a third party, they cannot ignore that contract and \nuse the property in a way that damages the third party’s rights. This means that although C was a \nstranger to the contract between A and B, he could be bound by it because of his knowledge of \nthe existing agreement. \n     \nFor instance, if A leases out his car to B for a year, then sells the car to C while the lease is still \nrunning  and C knows about the lease  C can’t just seize the car from B or use it in a way that \nbreaches B’s lease rights. Even though B and C have no contract between them, the court can \nissue an injunction to stop C from interfering. \n \n \nTORT \n      \nTort arises where a third party, with knowledge of an existing contract between two parties, \nintentionally induces one of them to breach the agreement, causing harm to the other. The \nelements required to establish this tort include the existence of a valid and enforceable contract, \nknowledge of the contract by the defendant, intentional inducement to breach the contract, and \nresulting damage to the claimant.  \nThough primarily developed in English common law, Nigerian courts have acknowledged its \napplicability under general tort law principles. The case of British Motor Trade Association v. \nSalvadori  [1949] Ch. 556 illustrates liability for such interference. While this is not a Nigerian \ndecision, it underscores a growing recognition that third-party interference in contractual \nrelations can be actionable in tort. Thus, even though a third party may not be privy to a contract, \nthey can still be held liable if they wrongfully cause a breach of that contract. \n \n \nTRUST CONCEPT \n     \nAnother significant legal mechanism for circumventing the privity rule is the trust concept. \nCourts in equity may find that a party to a contract holds rights in trust for a third-party \nbeneficiary, thereby allowing the beneficiary to enforce the contract. This is particularly \nimportant where contracts are expressly made for the benefit of a third party. In such situations, \none party (the promisor) may be seen as holding a contractual obligation in trust for the \nthird-party beneficiary. Sagay supports the recognition of the trust concept as a practical tool to \nallow enforcement by intended beneficiaries. The case of Tomlinson v. Gill (1756) Amb 330 is \ncited in support of this exception. Though an old English case, it laid the foundation for \nrecognizing the third party’s right through the trust mechanism. \n \n \nBANKERS COMMERCIAL CREDITS: \n      \nIn international trade, a Letter of Credit (LC) is commonly used. A bank usually at the buyer's \nrequest promises to pay the seller upon receipt of certain documents proving shipment, etc. There \nare three parties which are,Buyer (applicant),issuing bank,Seller (beneficiary). Despite the seller \nnot having a contract directly with the bank initially, the bank becomes obligated to pay once the \nseller presents conforming documents. \nThis scenario bypasses the privity rule. The beneficiary (seller), who’s not a party to the \nbuyer-bank contract, can still enforce payment from the bank. \nWe have cases like United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada \n[1983] 1 AC 168 where the House of Lords affirmed that once documents are in order, the bank \nmust pay, even if the underlying contract between buyer and seller is problematic. The case of \nHamzeh Malas & Sons v British Imex Industries Ltd [1958] 2 QB 127 reinforced that letters \nof credit are independent of the sale contract. The bank deals only in documents. \n \n \nINSURANCE CONTRACTS: \n      \nTypically, a contract of insurance is between the insurer and the insured. \nHowever, often a third party (e.g., beneficiary under a life insurance policy) is the one who \nbenefits from the contract. \nUnder traditional privity, the third party couldn’t enforce the contract. \nHowever, exceptions apply, and legislation (in many countries) has evolved to allow enforcement \nby third-party beneficiaries. \nThe case of Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1904] 2 KB \n658 Showed early recognition of third-party benefits in life insurance contracts, though the \nenforcement was still an issue. \nThe case of Darlington Borough Council v Wiltshier Northern Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 68 though \nnot directly about insurance but reflects the growing judicial trend to soften the privity doctrine, \nincluding for third-party beneficiaries. \n \n      \nIN CONCLUSION, the doctrine of privity of contract, though rooted in the principle that only \nparties to a contract can sue or be sued upon it, has evolved significantly through both judicial \ndecisions and statutory interventions. The general rule as reinforced in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre \nCo Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd [1915] AC 847 is that a third party cannot acquire rights or be \nsubjected to obligations arising under a contract to which they are not a party. This rule, though \nfundamental to contract law, has often proven rigid and unjust in practice. \n \nHowever, while privity upholds contractual autonomy, its rigidity has been tempered by \nequitable and statutory innovations. Nigerian courts, as in Ebhotav v. P.I & P.D. Co. Ltd., \nreconcile traditional privity with modern commercial needs by recognizing exceptions that \npromote justice. Globally, statutes like the UK’s 1999 Act reflect a trend toward third-party \ninclusivity, ensuring contracts serve broader societal interests without undermining foundational \nprinciples. Thus, privity endures as a dynamic doctrine, balancing party autonomy with evolving \nequitable imperatives. While the doctrine of privity of contract remains a cornerstone of contract \nlaw, its exceptions and statutory reforms have significantly eroded its absoluteness. The \nevolution of third-party rights reflects the law’s adaptability to commercial and equitable needs, \nensuring that contractual intentions are honored even where strict privity would otherwise \nprevent enforcement.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nPrimary Case Law References \n \nAjayi v.

The most basic definition of a contract is that it is an agreement which is valid and \nbinding at law, that is, agreements that the courts of law will enforce.1 Conversely, this means \nthere are agreements that are not legally binding, often due to the absence of some essential \nelements of a contract or, at times, because of certain defects that may render it invalid. \n \nBeyond these deficiencies, there are specific categories of people who enjoy a special status in \ncontractual transactions and relationships.2 A contract may not be enforceable against these sets \nof people as a form of legal protection, due their circumstances which  makes them susceptible to \nfraud or exploitation in the process of making bargains. This leads us to the concept of \ncontractual capacity. \n                                                          \n                                                   CONTRACTUAL CAPACITY  \nContractual capacity refers to the legal ability or competence of a person or entity to enter into a \nbinding contract.3 It is one of the critical elements of a valid contract alongside offer, acceptance, \nconsideration and the intention to create legal relations.If a party lacks contractual capacity at the \ntime of agreement, the contract may be void, voidable, or unenforceable depending on the \ncircumstances.This is done to protect certain categories of people, including illiterates, infants, \nintoxicated persons, and those of unsound mind (lunatics), as they may lack the capacity to fully \nunderstand or commit to contractual obligations.  \n \n     The legal basis and importance of this doctrine is the fact that in contract law, all parties to a \ncontract must have the mental ability and legal standing to understand the nature and \nconsequences of the contract they are entering into as it affects their legal rights and duties. This \nrequirement serves to shield vulnerable groups, ensures that no party is exploited, deceived, or \nforced into a contract they do not fully understand or are legally not allowed to enter.     \n \n3 Olga Asheychik “Contractual Capacity – A Part of the Contract Management Process You Shouldn't \nOverlook”  available at https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/contractual-capacity/ accessed 2025 \n2 Ibid \n1 I.E Sagay “Nigerian Law of Contract”, 3rd ed. (Sweet & Maxwell: London, 1985) P 1 \n \n        \n Those who have the capacity to enter a contract include adults age of majority – In most \njurisdictions, the age of majority is 18 years but as settled in Labinjoh V. Abake,4 it is 21 years \nin Nigeria. Once a person reaches this age, they are presumed to have full capacity to enter a \ncontractual transaction. It also includes literates who fully understand the terms of a contract, and \nthose who have sound mind, which has not been altered due to insanity or drunkenness. In \naddition, corporations , companies can have contractual capacity through their authorized \nrepresentatives or officials. Therefore, this essay seeks to examine the extent to which the \ncapacity of various persons ( illiterate, infant, lunatic and drunken persons) and establishments ( \ncorporations ) is capable of rendering a contract void, voidable or unenforceable. \n \n                                                    Capacity of an illiterate  \nIn understanding the capacity of an illiterate, It's imperative to understand what the meaning of \nan illiterate entails. An illiterate, in the context of contract law, refers to someone who cannot \nread or write in the language in which the contract is written.  As defined in P.Z & Co Ltd v. \nGusau and Kantoma,5 an illiterate person refers to a person who is unable to read the document \nin the language in which it was written  \n \nAlso, as expressed, in SCOA Zara V. Okon,6 a person may be capable of signing his name and \nreading figures but may not be literate enough to understand the effects of the document he is \nsigning. As such, when issues of illiteracy arises, the law seeks to offer special protection to the \nilliterate party in order to prevent exploitation. The primary legislation safeguarding the rights of \nilliterates is the Illiterates Protection Act (IPA).7 As provided under Section 3 of the IPA,  The \nIlliterate Protection Act in Sec. 3,  lays down certain duties which the writer of any document \nmade on behalf of an illiterate person must comply  \nwith: \n●​  Write his name and address on the document: to show that he was instructed to write the \ndocument and that it represents the intention of the illiterate. \n7 Cap.83, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (1958) \n6 (1960) N.R.N.L.R. 34 \n5 (1961) N.R.N.L.R. 1 \n4 (1924) 5 N.L.R. 33. \n \n        \n●​  Ensure that the document is read over and explained to the illiterate person before he \nsigns and that the signature or mark was made by the illiterate. \nAlso,  Sec. 8 of the Land Instruments Registration Law8 provides that no instruments, \nwherein one of the grantors is an illiterate, shall be registered unless it has been executed by such \nilliterate grantor(s) in the presence of a Magistrate or a Justice of Peace as a witness thereto.  \n \nFailure to comply with the provision of the Laws could result in effects such as; making the \ncontract illegal, void, voidable, or unenforceable. In UAC V. Edem & anor,9 the plaintiff’s \naction against the defendant/guarantor for the debt of one of their customers failed because the \ndefendant pleaded illiteracy and the plaintiff’s clerk who was held to be the writer of the \ndocument failed to comply with the requirements of the law. The court held the guarantee null, \nvoid and unenforceable against the defendant. This is because once it is established that a party \nto the contract is illiterate, the presumption is that he has no capacity to understand the terms of \nthe contract. The only way to rebut this is to show that the writer explained the terms contained \nin the document to the understanding of the illiterate party – see Osefor V. Uwania.10 \n \nHowever, it should be noted that though the law seeks to protect illiterate parties from being \nexploited, defrauded, or oppressed in a contract, “ it does not(…)provides him with a weapon to \ncheat others.”11 Thus, if in a contract, a party who understood the terms of a contract decides to \nuse the plea of illiteracy to evade his obligations to such contract, he would be denied the \nprotection of law. In  Lawal v. G.B. Ollivant (Nigeria) Ltd,12  the court, having concluded that \nthe plaintiff understood what he was doing, held that the plaintiff is outside the protection of law. \n \n                                              CAPACITY OF AN INFANT  \nIn contract law, “infants” does not necessarily connote babies.  It refers to minors, that is, persons \nwho are below the age of majority. The contractual age in Nigeria, which is governed by English \nlaw, is 21 years.13 Thus, contracts involving minors, in this case, infants, are treated differently \n13 I.E Sagay “Nigerian Law of Contract”, 3rd ed. (Sweet & Maxwell: London, 1985) P 399 \n12 1970 2 A.L.R. 208 \n11 Lawal v. G.B. Olivant (Nigeria) Ltd 1970 2 A.L.R. 208 \n10 1971 1 A.LR. 421 \n9 (1958) N.R.L.R. 33. \n8 Cap. 56, Laws of Western Nigeria (1959) \n \n        \nfrom those involving adults due to concerns about their capacity to understand the effects of \ncontractual relations. Historically, some had argued for the application of customary law in the \ndetermination of contractual age ( i.e where adulthood begins at puberty, around 12-14 years), \nhowever, this position was rejected in Labinjoh v. Abake – a case which has ever since, settled \nthe issue of contractual age in Nigeria.  \n \n The defendant, who was 18, bought goods on credit for trading purposes. She refused to pay as \nagreed under the contract and the plaintiff brought an action to recover the amount owed. The \ndefendant pleaded infancy and relied on the owed. The defendant pleaded infancy and relied on \nthe Infants Relief Act 187414 which made a contract to supply goods for trading purposes to an \ninfant void. The court  \nheld the contract void and unenforceable as the defendant was below 21 years. \n \nGenerally, there are three categories of contracts in which an infant can enter. These categories \ninclude those contracts; that are binding,  that are voidable and those that are  absolutely void.15 \nIn terms of those that are binding, they include contracts for necessaries and beneficial contracts \nof service. The supply of necessaries provides an exception to the general rule that infants cannot \nbe held liable to their contracts. This doctrine recognizes that infants must be able to obtain \ngoods and services important to their welfare, and that suppliers of such necessaries should be \nable to recover compensation for what they provide.  \n \nThe concept of necessaries has been developed through case laws and covers both necessary \ngoods such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. The legal test for determining what \nconstitutes necessaries involves two stages that reflect the courts’ careful approach to balancing \nprotection with practicality. The first stage requires an objective assessment of whether the goods \nor services in question are capable of being necessaries for an infant in the defendant’s particular \nposition and circumstances. This objective test considers factors such as the infant’s social status, \neducational background, and general life circumstances to determine whether the goods or \nservices could reasonably be considered necessary for someone in that position. \n15 I.E Sagay “Nigerian Law of Contract”, 3rd ed. (Sweet & Maxwell: London, 1985) PP 401-402  \n14 Infant Relief Act, 1874 \n \n        \nThe second stage involves a subjective examination of whether the infant actually needed the \ngoods or services at the time of the contract and delivery. This subjective test is crucial because it \nprevents suppliers from recovering goods or services that, while they can be said to be suitable to \nthe infant’s station in life, were not actually required because the infant was already adequately \nsupplied with such necessaries. These approaches ensure that the intended purpose of enabling \ninfants to obtain what they genuinely need while preventing exploitation through the supply of \nunnecessary luxury are achieved. \n \nIn Nash v. Inman,16 a case which involved the plaintiff's attempt to recover payment for \nclothing, including eleven fancy waistcoats, supplied to a Cambridge undergraduate. The Court \nof Appeal’s decision in this case established crucial principles that continue to govern contract \nlaw today. In Nash v Inman, an undergraduate infant obtained expensive clothes from the \nplaintiff which included  \neleven fancy waistcoats. The defendant did not pay and the plaintiff sued. It was established that \nthe waistcoats were not necessaries even though they were appropriate to the infant’s status in \nlife. The court held that, where an infant already had enough fancy waistcoats, more cannot be \nnecessary. Note that where the goods are necessaries, the infant is  \nprotected as he is expected to pay a reasonable price as provided for in Sec. 3 of the Sales of \nGoods Act.17 \n \nFurthermore, it's important to note that a contract is not binding on an infant  \nmerely because it is proved to be for the infant’s benefit. A contract which would have been \nbinding as a contract for necessaries may be voided if it contains harsh and onerous terms. Also, \nan infant’s wife has authority to pledge her husband’s credit for necessaries. This is because  \nnecessaries for an infant’s immediate family are viewed as necessaries for the infant – see \nChapple v Cooper.18 \n \nIn terms of a contract of beneficial services, the contract is binding on the infant. It refers to the \ntype of contract wherein he receives training or instruction for his future career. These forms of \n18 (1844) 13 M & W 253 \n17 s.3 of Sales of Goods Law, West  \n16 (1908)2 K.B. 1 \n \n        \ncontract are necessary and beneficial to the infant. What the court considers in determining the \nplausibility and validity of contracts of service is the benefit element of the contract. It must be \nsubstantially to the infant’s advantage and benefit. Any part of the contract that is meant to \nexploit the inexperience of the infant is not binding. Thus, in Doyle v. White City Stadium,19 \nwhere the court considered a professional boxing contract entered into by an infant. Despite the \ncontract being related to the infant’s profession, the court held that it was not binding because its \nterms were not substantially for the infant’s benefit. \n \nNow, for voidable contracts, they are valid and enforceable only at the option of the party whom \nthe law seeks to protect. Thus where an infant enters into a contract  \nof this nature, it is binding but the law allows him to void it and refuse to honour his obligations. \nThe general rule regarding this is that such contracts are valid and binding on the infant unless \nand until they are repudiated any time within infancy or within a reasonable time thereafter. \nExamples of this are where he acquires interest of a permanent nature in property such as \nleaseholds, shares in a company, partnership or marriage settlement to which continuing \nobligations attach — see Steinberg v. Scala Ltd.20 \n \nThe last category involves contracts that are void ab initio when entered into by an infant. This is \nas provided for in SEC. 1  of the  Infant Relief Act 1874. The contracts include; Contracts for \nthe payment of money lent or to be lent, contracts for goods supplied or to be supplied which are \nnot necessaries, and accounts stated – that is an admission of debt or I.O.U. \n \n                                                CAPACITY OF A LUNATIC \nAs said from the foregoing, for a contract to exist, both parties must have the capacity to \nunderstand what he or she is entering into and in this case, lunatic is no exception. According to \nthe Black's Law Dictionary, a lunatic refers to a person of deranged or unsound mind.21 This is, \na person whose mental faculties are in the condition called lunacy – the impairment of the mind's \nfaculties. This section will delve into the contractual capacity of a lunatic; those contracts that are \nvoid or voidable at his instance. \n21 H.C Black “Black's Law Dictionary” 2nd ed. ( West Publishing Co. Minnesota 1910)  \n20 (1923) 2 Ch. 451 \n19 (1935) 1 K B. 110 \n \n        \n \nGenerally, contracts concluded by a lunatic or mentally disordered person can be classified into \ntwo; contracts for necessaries and contracts for any other things. According to Sec. 2 of the Sales \nof Goods Act, necessaries means; \n“goods suitable to the condition in life of such infants or minor or other persons, and to \nhis actual requirements at the time of sale and delivery.” \nAlso, according to the Black's Law Dictionary, necessaries refers to those things that are \nindispensable, proper and useful for the sustenance of human life. Hence, in such a situation \nwherein necessaries are sold or delivered to a person who, according to Sec. 2 of the Sales of \nGoods Act, suffers from mental incapability and the incompetency to contract, he must pay a \n“reasonable price” because such contracts are binding on him just like every other person. \n \nHowever, where the goods are not necessaries, the mentally disordered person is also bound by \nhis contract, unless he or she can show that; he did not understand what he or she was doing \nwhen the contract was entered as a result of his mental impairment; the other party was aware of \nhis incapability. Thus, the landmark case of Imperial Loan Co. Ltd V. Stone,22 presents an \ninstance wherein a party having into a contract that does not deal with necessaries, seeks to use \nlunacy as defence. \n \nThe fact of the above case centered around a promissory note signed by a person later found to \nbe of unsound mind. The core issue was whether the defendant's insanity, at the time of signing, \nrendered the contract (the promissory note) unenforceable due to his incapability to understand \nthe implications of the agreement, and if so, whether the plaintiff's (Imperial Loan Co. Ltd.) \nknowledge of the defendant's insanity was a necessary element. The court ruled that for the \ncontract to be voidable due to insanity, the defendant needed to prove both their incapacity to \nunderstand the contract and the plaintiff's awareness of their unsoundness of mind.  \n \nAlso, Stroud V. Marshall23 presented an action of debt on an obligation. The defendant pleaded \nthat at the time the obligation was entered into, he was insane. The court of Queen's bench held \n23 Columbia Law Review “Nature of the Liability at Law of Necessaries” available at \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/1108978?seq=1 accessed 2025 \n22 (1892) 1 Q.B. 599 \n \n        \nthat this was not a good plea, \"for he cannot save himself by such a plea” as he was expected to \nshow that his condition prevented him from understanding what he was doing and that the other \nparty was aware of it. In Cross v. Andrews, the same Court had occasion to deal with a case \nwhere an innkeeper was sued in an action upon the case for failing to keep safely the goods of \nthe plaintiff, a guest. The defendant pleaded that he was insane at the time the plaintiff lodged \nwith him. The court held for the plaintiff. “For the defendant, if he will keep an inn, ought at his \nperil, to keep safely his guest's goods… and to say he is of non-sane memory, it lieth not in him \nto disable himself no more than in debt upon an obligation.” \n \nFurthermore, contracts entered into by a mentally disordered person during a period known as \nthe lucid period are also binding on him. A lucid period refers to the temporary interval of mental \nclarity or normalcy during which such a person can understand their actions and also make \ndecisions that are rational such as entering into contract and ratification of earlier contracts. \nHowever, it is important to note that if he establishes the fact that he was mentally disordered \nwhen he entered the contract, and that the other party was aware of his mental condition, such a \ncontract becomes rather than being void ab initio, voidable at his instance. \n \n                               CAPACITY OF A DRUNKEN PERSON \nThe contractual capacity of a person who is intoxicated, that is, a drunken person, is a specific \narea of contract law that deals with the impact of a temporary mental impairment on the ability to \nform a rationally binding agreement. The general principle is that a contract entered into by an \nintoxicated person is voidable at the option of the intoxicated party, but only under specific \nconditions. Thus, for an intoxicated person to successfully argue that they lacked capacity and as \na result, void the contract, two main conditions are generally expected to be met and the include; \n \nDegree of Intoxication: The person must have been so intoxicated at the time of entering the \ncontract that they were incapable of understanding the nature and effect of the transaction or \nwhat they were doing.24 The impairment must be significant enough to negate true consent and \ncomprehension. \n \n24 I.E Sagay “Nigerian Law of Contract”, 3rd ed. (Sweet & Maxwell: London, 1985) P 411 \n \n        \nOther Party's Knowledge: The other contracting party must have been aware or ought to have \nbeen aware of the intoxicated person's condition and their inability to understand the contract.25 \nThus, as held in Gore V. Gibson,26 a contract entered into by a person so intoxicated as not to \nknow the consequences of his act is not binding if he can show that his condition was known to \nthe other person. However, wherein the other party claims ignorance, adopting the objective test \ni.e the layman reasoning, becomes helpful. \n \n                                                         Legal Consequences    \n \n Voidable, not Void: This is a crucial distinction. The contract is not automatically invalid. The \nintoxicated person has the option to affirm or repudiate the contract once they regain sobriety and \nfull understanding. Hence, as held in Matthews V. Baxter,27  if a drunken party upon coming to \nhis senses, ratifies the contract, he is bound by it. \n \nRepudiation: To repudiate the contract, the intoxicated person must do so within a reasonable \ntime after regaining sobriety. Delay in repudiation can imply ratification of the contract. \n \n  Restitution: If the contract is successfully repudiated, both parties generally must be restored to \ntheir original positions (doctrine of restitution). This means any money paid or goods \ntransferred must be returned. \n \n Contracts for Necessaries: An important exception exists for \"necessaries.\" If an intoxicated \nperson enters into a contract for goods or services considered necessaries (e.g., food, shelter, \nessential medical care), they are generally obligated to pay a reasonable price for them as spelt \nout in the Sales of Goods Act, even if the other party is aware of his condition or not, or whether \nor not they lacked full capacity at the time of entering the contract. This is often based on \nquasi-contractual principles (obligation arising from benefit received) rather than true contractual \ncapacity.” \n \n27 (1873) L.R 8 \n26 (1845) 13 M & W 623 \n25 Ibid \n \n        \n                                          CAPACITY OF CORPORATIONS  \nJust like the capacity possessed by natural persons to enter a contract as treated from the \nforegoing, corporations possess certain capacity to enter into a contract.The capacity of a \ncorporation to enter into a contract refers to its legal ability to be a party to a contract. In other \nwords, just as individuals must have the mental and legal capacity to contract, so does a \ncorporation. However, because a corporation is an artificial legal person, its capacity is not based \non age or mental competence, but rather on the powers granted to it by law and its constitutional \ndocuments. \n \n Therefore, once a company has been registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act \n(CAMA),28 it becomes a body corporate, that is, a legal person separate and distinct from the \nindividuals who are the members. Thus it can operate like a natural person capable of rights and \nsubject to liabilities. It can sue and be sued in its own name and own property.  \n \nHowever, the artificial nature of the company places some limitations on it. The extent of its \npowers is limited by the objects as set out in the Memorandum  \nof Association. Thus a company cannot enter into a contract outside the powers specified in its \nmemorandum, otherwise, such a contract is ultra vires (i.e. beyond the powers) and is thus void. \nThis is in accordance with S. 39 of CAMA which states that; \n“A company shall not carry on any business not authorized by its memorandum and shall \nnot exceed the powers conferred upon it by its memorandum or this Act” \n \nIn conclusion, capacity is a foundational rule of contract law, essential for ensuring agreements \nare binding. Its role in contract formation is to safeguard individuals who, due to their \ncircumstances, might be easily exploited, defrauded, or oppressed when making a bargain. \nEssentially, it guarantees that those unable to contract because they don't fully understand the \nterms and implications of an agreement have the choice to either ratify or repudiate it when \nnecessary. \n \n28 Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 1990", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 3.pdf"}

Oyedoyin Oyindamola C. 2429415.\nThe Hardship caused by Pinnel's case on\nthe Defendant and Means of Equitable\nintervention.\nIntroduction: The Strictures of Common Law and the\nGenesis of Injustice\nThe common law of contract, a cornerstone of English jurisprudence, has historically placed\nparamount importance on the doctrine of consideration. This fundamental principle dictates that for\nan agreement to be legally enforceable, there must be a \"quid pro quo,\" or a mutual exchange of\nvalue between the contracting parties. This requirement ensures that promises are not gratuitous\nbut are instead supported by a bargained-for exchange, thereby underpinning the validity and\nenforceability of contractual obligations.\nWithin this framework, Pinnel's Case, decided in 1602, emerged as a foundational, albeit\ncontroversial, ruling concerning the repayment of debts. The case established a strict common law\nprinciple: the payment of a lesser sum on the due date cannot constitute full satisfaction of a\ngreater debt, even if the creditor had verbally agreed to accept it. The rationale behind this rule was\nrooted in the absence of fresh consideration; the debtor, in paying a portion of what was already\nowed, provided no new value to the creditor beyond an existing legal obligation. This principle, often\nsimply referred to as the Rule in Pinnel's Case, became a significant aspect of English contract law\nregarding debt repayment, influencing subsequent legal developments for centuries.\nHowever, the rigid application of Pinnel's Case frequently led to outcomes perceived as unfair or\nunjust. Debtors who, in good faith, relied upon a creditor's promise to accept a reduced payment\noften found themselves still liable for the full amount, despite their efforts to comply with the\nmodified agreement. This created a palpable tension between the strict adherence to legal principle\nand the practical realities of commercial dealings or notions of moral fairness. Such situations\nhighlighted a critical need for a corrective mechanism within the legal system. This is precisely\nwhere the body of law known as equity began to assert its influence. Equity developed specifically to\nmitigate the harshness and rigidity of the early common law, which often produced arbitrary and\nunjust results. It emerged as a flexible, conscience-driven system designed to supplement and\nmodify the common law, rather than destroy it, by providing remedies and principles tailored to the\nspecific circumstances of a case where common law rules fell short.\nThe foundational nature of consideration in common law contracts, as starkly illustrated by Pinnel's\nCase, created an inherent vulnerability for debtors. The common law system, prioritizing certainty\nand predictability, constructed its contractual edifice upon the strict requirement of consideration.\nWhen Pinnel's Case applied this rigorously to debt, it declared that paying a sum less than what was\nowed provided no new consideration for discharging the entire obligation. This meant that a debtor,\neven if explicitly promised forgiveness for a part payment, remained legally liable for the full amount.\nTheir reliance on the creditor's promise was, from a common law perspective, legally irrelevant. This\ncreated a situation akin to a legal trap, where a debtor's good faith actions based on a clear\nunderstanding could be undone by the creditor's subsequent insistence on strict legal rights. This\ninherent rigidity, while aiming to promote contractual certainty, inadvertently disregarded the\npracticalities of good faith negotiations and the potential for genuine reliance, thereby setting the\nstage for equitable intervention to address the resulting hardship and injustice.\nThe Common Law Rule: Pinnel's Case and its Affirmation\nThe Genesis of the Rule in Pinnel's Case\nPinnel's Case (1602) stands as a landmark decision in English contract law, despite the core\nprinciple being articulated in obiter dictum rather than as a direct ratio decidendi. The dispute arose\nbetween Pinnel, a creditor, and Cole, his debtor. Cole owed Pinnel eight pounds and ten shillings, due\non November 11, 1600. Cole contended that Pinnel had agreed to accept a partial payment of five\npounds, two shillings, and several pennies, made early on October 1, 1600, in full satisfaction of the\ndebt. Pinnel accepted this early payment but subsequently sued Cole for the entire original amount.\nThe court's ruling, though ultimately favoring Pinnel due to deficiencies in Cole's defense,\nestablished a pivotal principle: payment of a lesser sum on the day the debt is due cannot be\nsatisfaction for the whole. However, the court did acknowledge that certain conditions could alter\nthis outcome. Specifically, early payment or payment in a different form (such as a \"horse, hawk, or\nrobe\") could constitute sufficient consideration to discharge the entire debt, as these circumstances\nmight be more beneficial to the creditor than receiving the full sum on the due date. In Cole's\nspecific instance, his early payment should have made Pinnel's vow legally enforceable, but his\ndefense was insufficiently presented, leading to Pinnel's victory by default.\nThe Principle of \"No Consideration for Part Payment\"\nThe essence of the rule in Pinnel's Case lies in the common law's strict adherence to the doctrine of\nconsideration. The principle dictates that a promise to accept a lesser sum in discharge of a greater\ndebt is unenforceable because the debtor, in paying only a part, provides no fresh consideration for\nthe creditor's promise to forgo the balance. The debtor is already under a pre-existing legal\nobligation to pay the full amount, and performing an existing duty is not regarded as new value in the\neyes of the common law. This rule has been described as one of the \"greatest mysteries of the\ncommon law,\" often criticized for its formalistic nature and its perceived disconnect from\ncommercial realities. The rule is based on the premise that money has a fixed value, a notion that\nhas been challenged as a fallacy, given that the value of money can fluctuate from the perspective of\nboth the creditor and the market.\nFoakes v Beer and the Reaffirmation of the Rule\nThe principles established in Pinnel's Case were rigorously tested and unequivocally reaffirmed in\nthe seminal House of Lords case of Foakes v Beer (1884). Dr. John Weston Foakes owed Julia Beer\na judgment debt of £2,090 19s. Beer agreed not to take action against Foakes if he paid an initial\nsum of £500 and then £150 semi-annually until the principal was repaid. Foakes paid the principal\namount, but Beer subsequently sued him for the interest that had accrued on the judgment debt.\nThe House of Lords, upholding the Court of Appeal's decision, ruled in favour of Beer. They reasoned\nthat Foakes's promise to pay a debt he already owed did not constitute sufficient consideration for\nBeer's promise to waive the interest. This decision cemented Pinnel's Case as binding precedent,\nreinforcing the controversial pre-existing duty rule in the context of part payments.\nDespite this strict application, the judgment in Foakes v Beer was not without judicial reservation.\nLord Blackburn, while ultimately assenting to the judgment, expressed significant discomfort with\nthe rule. He noted his \"conviction that all men of business, whether merchants or tradesmen, do\nevery day recognise and act on the ground that prompt payment of a part of their demand may be\nmore beneficial to them than it would be to insist on their rights and enforce payment of the whole\".\nThis observation underscored a profound disconnect between the rigid legal principle and the\npractical, often commercially sensible, actions of parties in the real world. Lord Blackburn's\nreluctance highlights the enduring tension between the common law's formalistic requirements and\nthe pragmatic needs of commerce. The persistence of this \"mystery\" for centuries, despite its\nperceived flaws and the creation of \"reductio ad absurdum\" examples by its exceptions (where, for\ninstance, a token item like a canary could constitute good consideration for a large debt, but a\nsmaller sum of money could not ), illustrates the common law's deep-seated adherence to\nprecedent and its slow, incremental evolution. This rigidity inherently paved the way for the\ndevelopment of equity's more flexible and fairness-oriented approach.\nLimited Common Law Exceptions to the Rule\nWhile the rule in Pinnel's Case and Foakes v Beer was strict, it was not entirely without exceptions,\nmany of which were noted in Pinnel's Case itself. These exceptions, however, are often\ncharacterized as \"artificial and technical distinctions\" that courts were \"eager to discover\" to\ncircumvent the rule's harshness. The key is that these exceptions introduce some form of \"fresh\nconsideration\" or additional benefit to the creditor, beyond merely paying a part of the existing debt.\nThe recognized common law exceptions include:\n●\nEarly Payment: If the debtor pays a lesser sum before the due date, this can be considered\ngood satisfaction for the whole debt. The benefit to the creditor lies in receiving payment\nearlier than contractually entitled, which may be more beneficial than the full amount on the\ndue date.\n●\nPayment in a Different Form (Chattel): If the debtor provides something other than money,\nsuch as \"the gift of a horse, hawk, [or] robe,\" this can constitute fresh consideration,\nregardless of its actual monetary value relative to the debt. The common law presumes that\nthe property has some special value to the creditor, even if less than the debt. This distinction\nhighlights the common law's emphasis on the form of consideration rather than its adequacy.\n●\nPayment at a Different Place: If the creditor agrees to accept a lesser sum paid at a location\ndifferent from the one stipulated in the original agreement, the detriment incurred by the\ndebtor in traveling to that new location can be deemed sufficient consideration for the\nsecondary agreement.\n●\nComposition with Creditors: An agreement made between a debtor and multiple creditors,\ntypically in insolvency situations, where creditors agree to accept a reduced sum in full\nsettlement of their debts, is generally binding. This is often formalized through a deed of\nsettlement or a deed of company arrangement.\nThese exceptions, while providing some flexibility, underscore the common law's formalistic\napproach. They demonstrate that the courts would go to considerable lengths to find a nominal\n\"benefit\" or \"detriment\" to satisfy the consideration requirement, even if the practical effect was\nsimilar to accepting part payment of money on the due date.\nIII. Hardship and Injustice: The Debtor's Dilemma\nThe strict application of the rule in Pinnel's Case, particularly as reinforced by Foakes v Beer,\nfrequently resulted in significant hardship and injustice for debtors. The core of this dilemma lay in\nthe common law's unwavering insistence on fresh consideration, which effectively disregarded the\nrealities of promises made and relied upon in commercial and personal dealings.\nOne of the primary hardships was the undermining of reliance and good faith. A debtor, facing\nfinancial difficulties or seeking to resolve a debt amicably, might enter into a verbal agreement with\na creditor to pay a reduced sum. The debtor, believing and relying on this promise, would then make\nthe agreed-upon partial payment, often altering their financial position or foregoing other\nopportunities as a result. However, under the strict common law rule, the creditor could later renege\non their promise and sue for the full outstanding balance, including any interest, as there was no new\nconsideration for the promise to accept less. This fostered an environment where creditors could\nact in \"bad faith,\" exploiting the legal loophole to their advantage after inducing reliance in the debtor.\nFor instance, in Foakes v Beer, Dr. Foakes paid the principal amount as agreed, presumably believing\nhis obligation was discharged, only to be sued for the interest Mrs. Beer had initially agreed to waive.\nThis scenario exemplifies the predicament: the debtor fulfilled their part of the modified agreement,\noften at some effort or sacrifice, only to face renewed demands for the full original amount,\nincluding components they believed were forgiven. The common law's rigid adherence to the\nrequirement of consideration meant that a debtor's genuine belief and reliance on a creditor's\npromise were legally irrelevant if no fresh consideration was provided. This effectively created a\nlegal trap for debtors, leaving them vulnerable to the creditor's change of mind, even after they had\nacted to their detriment by making the part payment.\nSuch situations highlighted a significant flaw in the common law's approach to contract\nmodifications, particularly concerning debt. While the common law valued certainty and the sanctity\nof original agreements, its strictness failed to account for the practicalities of commercial\nnegotiations, where flexibility and mutual concessions are often necessary. The rule's insistence on\na formalistic exchange, even when a lesser payment might be commercially more beneficial to the\ncreditor (as Lord Blackburn observed ), led to outcomes that were not only morally questionable but\nalso economically illogical. The common law, in its pursuit of strict principle, overlooked the moral\nand practical failings of a system that allowed a party to go back on their word after inducing\nanother party's reliance. This inherent injustice provided a compelling impetus for the development\nand application of equitable principles to temper the rigidity of the common law.\nEquitable Intervention: The Historical Development and\nNature of Equity\nThe perceived harshness and rigidity of the common law, particularly its inability to adequately\naddress situations where strict application led to unjust outcomes, gave rise to the parallel\ndevelopment of equity. Equity is a distinct body of law and procedures that originated with the Court\nof Chancery in England. Its primary purpose was to \"mitigate the harshness of the early common\nlaw,\" which, with its rigid forms and procedures, often produced arbitrary and unjust results.\nOrigins and Evolution of Equity\nHistorically, the common law system was characterized by its reliance on specific \"writs\" or forms of\naction. If a case did not fit squarely within an existing writ, there was no remedy, regardless of the\ninherent justice of the claim. This inflexibility led individuals to petition the King directly for justice,\nappealing to his conscience. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Chancellor, who\nbecame known as the \"keeper of the King's conscience\". The early Chancellors, often clerics,\ndispensed justice based on principles of conscience, fairness, and the \"laws of God,\" examining\ndefendants personally and looking at the \"substance over form\" of agreements. This marked the\nbeginning of equity as a \"court of conscience,\" not bound by the strictures of common law, and\nprepared to offer tailored, discretionary solutions.\nOver time, equity evolved from a purely discretionary system to one governed by more predictable\nprinciples, though still retaining its flexibility and discretionary nature compared to common law. It\ndeveloped as a \"meta-law\" that refines and enhances the fairness of common law default rules,\nrather than seeking to destroy them.\nA pivotal moment in the relationship between common law and equity was the enactment of the\nJudicature Acts of 1873-1875. These Acts fused the administration of common law and equity,\ncreating a single High Court where both sets of principles could be applied. This fusion meant that\nlitigants no longer had to pursue their claims in separate courts, and judges could apply equitable\nremedies and principles in common law actions. This institutional change was a prerequisite for the\nlater development and widespread application of equitable doctrines, such as promissory estoppel,\nas a direct \"inroad\" into rigid common law rules like that in Pinnel's Case.\nEquity's Role in Mitigating Common Law Harshness\nEquity's intervention in contract law primarily aimed to provide remedies and prevent injustices\nwhere common law rules were insufficient or led to unconscionable outcomes. While the common\nlaw focused on the strict formation and enforcement of contracts based on consideration and\nformalities (like deeds), equity looked beyond the form to the substance and intent of the parties.\nKey ways equity mitigated common law harshness include:\n●\nNew Remedies: Equity introduced remedies like specific performance (compelling a party to\nperform their contractual obligations) and injunctions (prohibiting certain actions), which were\navailable when common law damages were inadequate.\n●\nGood Faith and Unconscionable Dealings: Chancellors were concerned with the good faith\nnature of underlying obligations. They were prepared to enforce certain agreements without\nthe strict common law formalities (e.g., sealed documents) and provided relief in matters\nrelated to fraud and unconscionable dealings.\n●\nPreventing Operation of Common Law Judgments: Equity could prevent the operation of a\ncommon law judgment if one party had engaged in \"equitable fraud\" or if enforcing the\njudgment would be unconscionable.\n●\nFlexibility in Contract Modification: Unlike common law, which struggled with modifications\nlacking fresh consideration, equity developed principles to prevent a party from going back on\na promise if another party had relied on it, even without strict consideration. This is the\nessence of promissory estoppel.\nThe development of equity as a \"meta-law\" that refines common law, rather than destroying it,\nrepresents a continuous process of legal refinement. The shift from the discretionary \"King's\nconscience\" to a more systematized body of rules, particularly after the Judicature Acts, enabled\njudges to apply both common law and equitable principles concurrently. This fusion was crucial\nbecause it provided the necessary legal framework for the later development of doctrines like\npromissory estoppel, allowing them to directly challenge and temper the strictness of common law\nrules, such as the one established in Pinnel's Case.\nV. Promissory Estoppel: Equity's Inroad intoPinnel's Case\nThe doctrine of promissory estoppel represents one of equity's most significant interventions in\ncontract law, specifically addressing the rigidity imposed by the rule in Pinnel's Case and Foakes v\nBeer. It allows for the enforcement of certain promises, even in the absence of consideration,\nthereby mitigating the harshness that would otherwise arise from strict common law application.\nA. Origins and Early Development: Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co\nThe concept of promissory estoppel in English law can be traced back to the case of Hughes v\nMetropolitan Railway Co (1877). In this case, a landlord gave a tenant six months' notice to repair\npremises. During this period, negotiations began for the landlord to purchase the lease, leading the\ntenant to cease repairs. When negotiations broke down, the landlord sought to enforce the original\nrepair notice, arguing the tenant was in breach.\nThe House of Lords rejected the landlord's claim. Lord Cairns articulated a crucial equitable principle:\n\"if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal results...\nafterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has\nthe effect of making one side believe that the contract will be suspended or not enforced, the other\nside cannot enforce the contract if it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have\nthus taken place between the parties\". The court held that the notice to repair was suspended during\nnegotiations and only revived once negotiations ceased, giving the tenant reasonable time to\ncomplete the repairs from that point.\nThis case, while not directly concerning part payment of debt, established the foundational equitable\nprinciple that a party's conduct could lead to the suspension of their strict legal rights, even without\nfresh consideration, if it would be inequitable to allow them to go back on their implied promise. This\nwas a direct challenge to the common law's strict formalism, demonstrating equity's capacity to\nmodify the enforcement of existing contractual obligations based on fairness and reliance.\nIt is noteworthy that Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co remained largely \"unremarkable\" and\ninfrequently applied for many years after its decision. Its full potential and significance were not\nwidely recognized until it was \"unearthed\" and extensively developed by Lord Denning in the mid-\n20th century. This historical trajectory highlights that while equitable principles may exist, their\nwidespread adoption and impact often depend on judicial activism and a willingness to apply them\nto address evolving legal and commercial realities.\nB. The Modern Doctrine: Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees\nHouse Ltd\nThe modern application and significant extension of promissory estoppel, particularly as an \"inroad\"\ninto the rule in Pinnel's Case, is largely attributed to Lord Denning's judgment in Central London\nProperty Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd (1947). During World War II, many flats in London were\nvacant. Central London Property Trust Ltd (landlord) agreed to reduce the ground rent of a block of\nflats leased by High Trees House Ltd (tenant) from £2,500 to £1,250 per year. This agreement was\nin writing but lacked consideration for the reduction. By 1945, the flats were fully occupied, and the\nlandlord sought to recover the full original rent for the last two quarters of that year, and\nhypothetically, for the entire period since 1940.\nDenning J held that the full rent was recoverable from mid-1945 when the flats became fully\noccupied. However, in a powerful obiter dictum, he stated that if the plaintiffs had sued for the full\nrent during the wartime period (1940-1945), they would have been prevented from doing so by the\nprinciple of promissory estoppel. He articulated the principle: \"a promise made which was intended\nto create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going\nto be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on\" is binding.\nCrucially, Denning J explicitly linked this principle to the long-standing rule in Pinnel's Case and\nFoakes v Beer. He commented that \"the logical consequence, no doubt is that a promise to accept a\nsmaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of\nconsideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the better\". He noted\nthat this aspect was not considered in Foakes v Beer.\nThe significance of Denning's obiter dictum in High Trees cannot be overstated. Despite being non-\nbinding precedent, it laid the groundwork for the modern doctrine of promissory estoppel, directly\nchallenging centuries of common law adherence to the consideration rule in debt part payment. This\ndemonstrates the persuasive power of judicial reasoning, particularly when it addresses a perceived\ninjustice and aligns with commercial realities, as Lord Blackburn had noted in Foakes. It illustrates\nhow judicial commentary can profoundly shape future legal development, even without being strictly\nbinding. The judgment served as a powerful declaration that the fusion of law and equity, achieved\nby the Judicature Acts, necessitated a reconsideration of rigid common law principles in light of\nfairness and reliance.\nC. Elements and Application of Promissory Estoppel\nFor promissory estoppel to apply and provide relief to a debtor in a part payment scenario, several\nkey elements must be satisfied. These elements collectively ensure that the doctrine is applied\njudiciously to prevent injustice without undermining the fundamental principles of contract law.\nThe core elements typically required are:\n1.\nA Clear and Unequivocal Promise: The promisor (creditor) must have made a clear and\ndefinite promise, through words or conduct, that they do not intend to enforce their strict legal\nrights (e.g., to demand the full debt). Ambiguous statements generally do not suffice.\n2.\nReliance by the Promisee: The promisee (debtor) must have genuinely relied on that promise\nand acted upon it. This reliance must be reasonable and foreseeable to the promisor. For\nexample, if a debtor makes a part payment and alters their financial plans based on the belief\nthat the remaining debt is forgiven, this constitutes reliance.\n3.\nDetriment to the Promisee (or change in position): The promisee must have suffered actual\nharm, such as financial loss, lost opportunities, or significant inconvenience, as a result of\ntheir reliance on the promise. While some jurisdictions may not require strict \"detriment,\" there\nmust be a change in position such that it would be unjust for the promisor to go back on their\nword. This element directly addresses the \"hardship and injustice\" component of the user\nquery, demonstrating how equity provides a remedy for those who acted on a promise to their\ndetriment.\n4.\nInequity: It must be inequitable or unconscionable for the promisor to go back on their\npromise and insist on their strict legal rights after the promisee has relied on it. This is the\noverarching equitable consideration, ensuring that the doctrine is applied to prevent unfair\nresults.\nWhen these elements are satisfied, promissory estoppel can prevent the creditor from denying the\nexistence of the modified agreement for lack of consideration, thereby providing relief to the debtor.\nIts purpose is to prevent \"unconscionable or unfair\" results that would otherwise arise from the strict\napplication of common law rules. The shift from strict consideration to reliance and inequity as the\nbasis for enforceability underscores equity's fundamental objective: to ensure fairness and prevent a\nparty from exploiting a legal technicality to the detriment of another who has acted in good faith.\n. The Effect of Promissory Estoppel: Suspensory or Extinctive?\nA critical aspect of promissory estoppel, particularly in the context of part payment of debt, is\nwhether its effect is merely suspensory or extinctive. This distinction determines whether the\noriginal contractual right is temporarily put on hold or permanently extinguished.\nTraditionally, English courts have held that promissory estoppel has a suspensory effect. This\nmeans that the original contractual obligation is suspended for a period or while certain conditions\nexist, but it can be revived by the promisor (creditor) upon giving reasonable notice, or when the\ncircumstances that gave rise to the promise cease. For example, in High Trees, the reduced rent was\nbinding only for the wartime period, and the original rent could be reinstated once the flats were fully\noccupied. This suspensory nature aligns with the principle that promissory estoppel acts as a \"shield,\nnot a sword\". It can be used as a defense to prevent a creditor from enforcing their strict legal rights,\nbut it generally cannot be used to create a new cause of action or to permanently extinguish a debt\nwithout consideration, as this would undermine the common law doctrine of consideration. This\nlimitation seeks to maintain the common law's fundamental requirement for new contracts while\nallowing equity to prevent unconscionable conduct in existing ones.\nHowever, the question of whether promissory estoppel can have an extinctive effect on a liquidated\ndebt has been a subject of considerable debate, particularly in light of the Court of Appeal's decision\nin Collier v P & MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd (2007). In Collier, Arden LJ suggested that if a debtor offers\nto pay a reduced sum, and the creditor voluntarily accepts it in satisfaction, and the debtor acts upon\nthat accord by paying the lesser sum, then it would be inequitable for the creditor to insist on the\nbalance. This judgment implied that in such circumstances, the debt could be extinguished, not\nmerely suspended.\nThe Collier decision has been met with both support and criticism. Proponents argue it provides a\nmuch-needed equitable remedy against the harshness of Foakes v Beer, allowing for a more just\noutcome where genuine reliance has occurred. Critics, however, contend that Collier \"stretched the\ndoctrine of promissory estoppel beyond its appropriate limits\" and is \"contrary to authority and\nprinciple\". They argue that it risks nullifying Foakes v Beer and undermining the fundamental\nrequirement of consideration, especially if detrimental reliance is no longer strictly required for the\nestoppel to arise. This ongoing academic and judicial debate highlights the enduring tension\nbetween upholding the strict common law rule of consideration and providing equitable relief. It\ndemonstrates the judiciary's struggle to reconcile centuries of precedent with the desire for fairness\nand commercial practicality, showcasing the dynamic and often contentious nature of legal\ndevelopment.\nConclusion: The Evolving Balance Between Common Law\nand Equity\nThe operation of the rule in Pinnel's Case, as strictly affirmed by Foakes v Beer, undeniably created\nsignificant hardship and injustice for debtors who relied on a creditor's promise to accept a lesser\nsum in full satisfaction of a debt. The common law's unwavering insistence on fresh consideration\nfor contract modifications, coupled with its formalistic interpretation of value, often meant that good\nfaith agreements to reduce debt were rendered unenforceable, leaving debtors vulnerable to\ncreditors who could renege on their promises. This rigidity fostered a legal environment where\ncommercial realities and principles of fairness were often overlooked.\nHowever, the historical development and intervention of equity have provided crucial mechanisms to\nmitigate these harsh outcomes. Originating as a \"court of conscience\" to supplement the rigid\ncommon law, equity evolved to provide remedies and principles founded on fairness, good faith, and\nthe prevention of unconscionable conduct. The fusion of common law and equity courts through the\nJudicature Acts paved the way for a more integrated legal system, enabling judges to apply\nequitable doctrines to temper common law strictures.\nPromissory estoppel stands as the preeminent example of this equitable intervention in the context\nof part payment of debt. From its nascent recognition in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co to its\npivotal development by Lord Denning in Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd,\nthe doctrine has created a vital \"inroad\" into the rule in Pinnel's Case. By allowing promises to be\nbinding, even without consideration, where there has been clear reliance and it would be inequitable\nto go back on the promise, promissory estoppel offers a shield to debtors, protecting them from the\nunjust enforcement of strict legal rights.\nWhile the precise scope and effect of promissory estoppel – whether it merely suspends or can\nextinguish a debt – remain subjects of ongoing legal debate, particularly following cases like Collier\nv P & MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd, its existence fundamentally alters the landscape of debt repayment.\nIt introduces a necessary element of flexibility and fairness, compelling creditors to honour promises\nupon which debtors have reasonably relied.\nUltimately, the discussion surrounding Pinnel's Case and equitable intervention illustrates the\ndynamic and continuously evolving relationship between common law and equity. This ongoing\ndialogue reflects the legal system's perpetual effort to balance the need for certainty and\npredictability with the imperative to achieve justice and prevent unconscionable outcomes in\ncommercial and personal dealings. The journey from the strict formalism of Pinnel's Case to the\nnuanced application of promissory estoppel is a testament to the legal system's capacity for self-\ncorrection and adaptation in the pursuit of equitable solutions.\nReferences\n1.\nBrenner, P.

INTRODUCTION \nContracts form the bedrock of modern commercial and personal transactions, serving as \nthe invisible thread binding parties to promises, obligations, and expectations. In the realm of \ncontract law, it is not merely the presence of an agreement that validates a contract, but rather \nthe integration of distinct, autonomous elements, each essential, none superior to the other. As \nemphasised in A.R.M.C. Ltd. v Elizade Nigeria Ltd.1\"All the essential elements of a contract \nare autonomous and equal,\" meaning that for a contract to attain legal validity and binding \nforce, every one of its fundamental components, i.e. offer, acceptance, consideration, \nintention to create legal relations and capacity, must be present and function in harmony. \nThis declaration not only reflects the judicial interpretation of contract law principles \nbut also reiterates the foundational philosophy that underpins contractual relationships in \nlegal systems globally. No single element can compensate for the absence of another. Each \nserves a specific and irreplaceable purpose. For instance, while an offer initiates the process \nof forming a contract, acceptance completes the agreement, consideration provides the value, \nintention confirms the seriousness, and capacity validates the parties involved. The absence \nof even one of these elements renders the agreement legally impotent. \nThe equality and autonomy of these essential elements reflect the broader principle of \nfairness in contractual dealings. When one considers that contracts are fundamentally \nagreements between parties with potentially unequal bargaining power, the legal system \nprovides a framework where the presence of all the elements acts as a safeguard against \nexploitation, misunderstanding, or manipulation. Therefore, these elements must be viewed \nnot in isolation, but as interlocking gears within a complex but carefully designed machine.  \n This principle has been emphasised by courts repeatedly, particularly in Nigeria, \nwhere the judiciary remains committed to upholding the sanctity of contracts. The judgment \nin A.R.M.C. Ltd. v Elizade Nigeria Ltd. reflects a growing awareness that contracts are not \nmere formalities but solemn engagements that must meet specific legal thresholds. These \nthresholds are not arbitrary; they exist to ensure that parties are not bound by vague, \nambiguous, or non-consensual agreements. \nUltimately, the demand that each essential element be present does not merely serve \nacademic neatness; it is a practical necessity. Courts cannot enforce a contract that lacks \n \n1 A.R.M.C. Ltd. v Elizade Nigeria Ltd. [2020] All FWLR pt. 1058 p.1030 \n \nP a g e  | 4 \n \nclarity, mutual assent, legal value, or capable parties. To do so would be to undermine the \nvery concept of enforceable obligations and plunge legal certainty into chaos. Thus, the legal \nsystem rightly insists on the autonomy and equal significance of all contractual elements, \nweaving them into the fabric of every valid and enforceable agreement. \nThe aim of this paper is to examine these essential elements in greater detail, \nanalysing their roles, interdependence, and application within Nigerian contract law, and \nsupporting this exploration with judicial authorities and practical examples. \n \n2. OFFER \n \nIn the formation of a contract, an offer is the starting point of a valid contract. An \noffer may be defined as a definite undertaking by one party with the intention of being bound \nas soon as it is accepted by the party to whom it is addressed. An offer contains certain terms \nthat a prospective offeree must examine properly before acceptance; and this means that an \noffer has to be precise, unequivocal and leave no room for speculation, ambiguity or double \nmeaning.  \nAn offer has also been defined as the expression by a party of readiness to contract on \nthe terms specified by him which, if accepted by the offeree, gives rise to a binding contract.2 \nIt is important to bear in mind that an invitation is not an offer; rather, it is an offer to receive \noffers, an offer to chaffer or an invitation to receive offers. \nAn invitation to treat is the first step in negotiations between the parties to a contract, \nwhich may or may not lead to a definite offer being made by one of the parties to the \nnegotiation. Because an invitation to treat is not an offer, it is not capable of acceptance and \ncannot lead to an agreement or contract. It rather serves as a preliminary to an offer.3 Some \npeople might mistake an invitation to treat with an offer, but they are not the same thing. \nSome situations can present an invitation to treat, such as; \n● Auctions: In an auction, an offer is not made. Rather, there is a call for offers from the \npeople, where the highest bidder wins. The mere fact that a person attended an auction \ndoes not mean that there is a contract between them and the auctioneer. They only \n \n2 I.E Sagay, Nigerian Law of Contract, Third Edition(revised), 2018, p. 19 \n3 Ibid, p. 23 \n \nP a g e  | 5 \n \naccepted the auctioneer's invitation, and it is left to them to make offers which the \nauctioneer can choose to reject or accept. If, however, the auctioneer chooses to \naccept bids, he is under a compulsion to accept the highest bid and go through with \nthe transaction once the hammer has fallen, as stated in Adebaje v. Conde4. \n● Display of goods on shelves in a shop: This has also been seen as a form of invitation \nto treat, and it is left to the buyer to pick up whatever they want and take it to the \nsalesperson. Therefore, the buyers are the ones making the offer, and the salesperson \nis left with the responsibility of accepting. For example, if a buyer picks up a goods to \nbuy and wanted to buy it for a price that is not up to par with the product, the sales \nperson can reject it and refuse to sell the product also before money is accepted, any \nof the parties to the transaction can refuse to carry on with it as there is no contract \nyet, thereby no liability. An instance is the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. \nBoots Cash Chemists. A binding contract only comes in when the salesperson accepts \nthe offer and money is paid.  \n● People standing at bus stations also constitutes an invitation to treat, and it is left to \nthe buses to stop and make an offer to take them to their destination, and the people to \naccept by mounting the bus. \n● Invitation to tender. \nAll these are invitations to treat and not offers, and thereby are not capable of \nacceptance.  \nAlso, for an offer to be capable of acceptance, it has to be accepted the way it was \npresented, i.e. with no form of modification or adjustment, the terms included in the offer \nhave to be followed to the letter without changes. An offer must be unconditionally and \nunqualifiedly accepted. In an instance where a party, the offeror, makes an offer to another, \nthe offeree, but the offeree proposes an adjustment to the terms of the original offer before \naccepting, the original offer will automatically be ineffective and now the offeree’s so-called \nmodification has constituted a ‘counter offer’ thereby cancelling the original offer. This, and \nothers have been regarded as types of offers, which upon defects -in form of acceptance- has \n \n4 Learn Nigerian Law (2025) Formation of Contract: Offer, Acceptance (Accessed 27th June, 2025); \nhttps://www.learnnigerianlaw.com/learn/contract-law/formation \n \nP a g e  | 6 \n \nled to the outright cancelation of the offer, and that, if accepted, will not create a binding \ncontract. These offers will be discussed as types of invalid acceptance under acceptance.  \nIn relating the case of A.R.M.C Ltd. v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd. and the subject matter of \noffer, it can be expressly seen from the case that an offer moved from the appellant i.e. \nA.R.M.C Ltd to the respondents and it was an offer clear without any form of speculative \nterms or ambiguity. The respondents also accepted this offer unconditionally without any \nmodifications or delay backed with consideration(payment). It is therefore inferred that there \nis a valid contract between the parties even without signing of the draft agreement since both \nparties have expressed interest clearly showing that they agree to be bound by the terms \nprovided by the contract. Therefore, the offer made in this case is a valid sort of offer with a \nvalid acceptance and consideration. \n \n3. ACCEPTANCE \n \nIn the Nigerian law of contract, as articulated by Professor I.E. Sagay in his book \ntitled Nigerian Law of Contract, acceptance is one of the cardinal pillars upon which a valid \ncontract stands. Without valid acceptance, a mere offer remains an unenforceable expression \nof interest. The case of ARMC Ltd v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd provides a pragmatic interpretation \nof these theoretical principles, particularly in situations where a formal contract document is \nabsent. \nAccording to Sagay, acceptance is the final and unqualified expression of assent to the \nterms of an offer.  It must mirror the terms of the offer completely and be communicated to \nthe offeror. Acceptance must be absolute, unconditional, and, if stated, made in the mode \nprescribed by the offeror. Any variation in the terms results in a counter-offer rather than an \nacceptance. The case of Hyde v. Wrench5 buttresses this. Sagay further outlines that \nacceptance can be by conduct or words, and that silence generally does not constitute \nacceptance unless previously agreed upon by the parties. \nAs highlighted by Sagay, the key elements of valid acceptance are: \n• Unqualified assent: Acceptance must match the offer (the mirror image rule). \n \n5 Hyde v. Wrench [1840] 3 Beav 334, EWCH Ch J90, 49 ER 132 \n \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n• Communication of acceptance: It must be communicated to the offeror, and the \ncontract is formed upon such communication. \n• Method of acceptance: It must follow the mode prescribed or a reasonable \nalternative. \n• Time Frame: Acceptance must be made within the time stipulated or within a \nreasonable time. \n• Awareness of offer: The acceptor must have full knowledge of the offer at the time of \naccepting. \nTYPES OF INVALID ACCEPTANCE  \n• Counter offer: Any qualification or amendment of the offer will constitue a counter \noffer, which destroys (cancels) the original offer. The purported acceptance this \nbecomes a fresh offer, which is open to the original offer or, now the offeree, to accept \nor reject. As seen in Best Nig. Ltd. V. Blackwood Hodge Nig. Ltd.  \n• Conditional acceptance: This is an acceptance made subject to a condition, and it \ncannot create a binding contract until that condition has been met or fulfilled. See \nMaja jnr. V. UAC.  \n• Cross offers: An offer must be given by one party, to the other party to either accept \nor refuse it. No two parties attempting to contract can send the same offer to each \nother. When two parties, identical in terms are sent by two parties to each other, by \npost or by any other means, and the offers “cross” in the post or en-route, there is no \ncontract. See the case of Tinn v. Hoffman& Co.6 \n• Acceptance in ignorance of offer: An offer cannot be puroortedto have been \naccepted when the party accepting has no knowledge of the offer. Whoever is not \naware of an offer and it’s details cannot be said to have accepted the offer. See \nGibbons v. Proctor.7 \n• Acceptance of Tenders: When a party advertises for tenders, it constitutes an \ninvitation to treat. See Great Northern Railway v. Witham.8 \n \n6Tinn v. Hofman &Co. (1873) 29 L.T. 271 \n7 Gibbons v. Proctor (1891) L.T. 594 \n8 Great Northern Railway v. Witham (1873) L.R. 9 C.P. 16 \n \nP a g e  | 8 \n \nIn A.R.M.C Ltd. v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd., the court was confronted with the question: “Can \nthere be valid acceptance, and thus a binding contract, where no formal contract was signed, \nbut other contractual elements had been performed?” \nThe Appellant (ARMC) argued that no contract existed because the Share Sale Agreement \n(SSA) was never formally signed. However, the Respondent (Elizade) contended that \nacceptance had occurred when it signified approval of the sale terms and made a substantial \npayment. \nThe court held that a valid contract existed, emphasising that: \n“The essential elements of a contract- offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention \nto create legal relations - were all present. Acceptance was established by conduct, \nnot just by correspondence. Elizade paid the purchase sum and began to act on the \nagreement, demonstrating an unambiguous intention to accept the terms offered. The \nabsence of a signed document did not negate acceptance, as the SSA was merely \nintended to formalise what had already been agreed upon.” \n Applying Sagay’s doctrine, the court affirmed that acceptance by conduct, especially \nwhen coupled with part-performance, binds the parties. \nThere are several legal implications arising from Sagay and A.R.M.C Ltd. v. Elizade Nigeria \nLtd. in relation to acceptance. These include: \n• Silence and delay do not invalidate acceptance if conduct shows otherwise: \nSagay argues that performance or partial execution of an agreement can constitute \nacceptance. This was affirmed in the ARMC case, where payment and performance \nserved as evidence of assent. \n• The mirror image rule may be flexible in practice: Although Sagay upholds the \nmirror image principle strictly, Nigerian courts, as shown here, may interpret \nconstructive acceptance where business realities and conduct reflect assent even \nwithout strict matching of terms. \n• Acceptance without signature can be valid: In line with Sagay, courts do not always \nrequire a formal signature where actions imply acceptance. In ARMC, the agreement \nwas not signed, yet acceptance was clear. \n \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n• Intention trumps formalities: Sagay notes that the parties’ intention to be bound is \nkey. The court reinforced this by holding that the intent to execute the contract and the \nsteps taken toward its fulfilment satisfied legal acceptance. \n \n4. CONSIDERATION \nA contractual agreement between two parties cannot be enforced by a party that has \nnot provided consideration, with the sole exception being a contract under seal. For a contract \nto be binding, there must be an exchange of promises that ensures mutual benefit. \nUnderstanding what constitutes consideration and what does not is crucial, as it is a \nfundamental aspect of contractual agreements.9 \nAccording to Lush, J., in Currie v. Misa10, Valuable consideration in the eyes of the \nlaw may consist of any right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party, or a \nforbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other \nparty. Essentially, consideration can be either a benefit conferred upon one party or a \ndetriment suffered by another as part of the contract. It is vital to note that the detriment does \nnot need to confer a benefit on the other party; its existence as a consequence of the contract \nsuffices. For example, if A enters into a contract to buy B’s house, the money paid by A is the \nconsideration from A, while B's transfer of title of the house constitutes the consideration \nfrom B. \nConflicts exist regarding what should be recognised as valid consideration under the \nlaw. Tangible items like money, property, or goods are typically indisputable forms of \nconsideration. However, intangible factors such as love, moral obligation, or affection have \nstirred debate. This question of moral obligation originated with Lord Mansfield in the 18th \ncentury but was effectively dismissed in the case of Eastwood v. Kenyon11. In this case, \nEastwood, who had spent personal funds to support Mrs. Kenyon while she was a minor, \nsought repayment after she reached maturity. The court ruled that moral obligation does not \nconstitute valid consideration12. In contrast, Barclays Bank D.C.O. v.

Faloughi14, have followed the precedent \nestablished in Eastwood v. Kenyon. \nOne major thing to note about consideration is that consideration must move from the \npromisee. The principle that consideration must move from the promisee signifies that only a \nparty who has provided consideration in a contract can bring an action to enforce that \ncontract. There are several scenarios that lead to a lack of consideration: \n• Total failure of consideration due to gratuitous promise: Promises made without \nconsideration may be unenforceable. In L.A. Cardoso v. The Executors of the Late J.A. \nDoherty15, The plaintiff discovered that despite promises made by the executors of a \ndeceased party to allow him to remain in a property, he could not enforce this promise \nas he provided no consideration. \n• Total failure of consideration where there is no performance by the plaintiff: If \nthere is no performance on the part of the plaintiff or they cannot demonstrate \nreadiness and willingness to perform, any action against the defendant will fail. This \nprinciple was established in Bank of West Africa v. Fagboyegun16, where it was found \nthat the contract had no performance. \n• Consideration provided by a third party: Parties who have not furnished \nconsideration cannot sue under the doctrine of privity, which allows only parties to a \ncontract to enforce it. For instance, in Gbadamosi v. Mbadiwe17, The court ruled \nagainst the plaintiff seeking to recover a loan given via his party to the defendant \nsince the consideration came from a third party. \n• Claims exceeding agreed benefits: A party can only claim benefits within the bounds \nof what is specified in the contract. In U.T.C. v. Hauri18, the court ruled that an \nundertaking obtained under duress without appropriate consideration was \nunenforceable. \nConsideration can also come in the form of a promise. This is the case in executory \nand executed contracts. An executory contract is an agreement where one party promises \nsomething in exchange for a promise from the other, typical of bilateral contracts.

Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke \nBall Co.19 exemplifies executed consideration, as the plaintiff was induced by purchasing the \nproduct. \nSome things may present themselves as consideration when, in fact, they are not. Let \nus take ‘Past Consideration’ for instance. Past consideration refers to acts performed before \nthe formation of a contract and thus is typically not recognised as valid consideration. An \nillustrative case is Re McArdle20, where prior improvements made on a shared house were \ndeemed insufficient when the parties later attempted to agree on payment. Exceptions exist \nwhen past actions were executed at a promisor's request with the understanding they would \nbe compensated, as established in Re Casey’s Patents.21 \nWhat exactly determines the adequacy and sufficiency of a consideration?  \nWhile the courts do not examine the adequacy of consideration (whether it is a fair trade \nor not), they do evaluate its sufficiency. For consideration to be recognised as valid, it must \nnot be vague, unascertainable, or meaningless.22 \n• Something of value in the eyes of the law: What constitutes value may be subjective; \nthus, courts work to establish objective standards. G.H. Treitel argues that consideration is \nvalid if recognised by law as having economic value, while opinions vary amongst \nacademics about its definition23. Courts have ruled that a party satisfies consideration by \nrelinquishing something valuable or refraining from exercising a right. \n• Performance of existing duty: If someone is already obligated to perform an act, can \nthey claim additional benefit? Generally, performing a legal duty is insufficient unless the \ntask exceeds legal requirements, as seen in cases like Collins v. Godefroy24 and \nGlassbrook Brothers Ltd. v. Glamorgan County Council25. \n• Duty imposed by contract: If someone is obligated under their existing contract, \nfulfilling that duty typically does not provide additional valid consideration unless the \n \n19 Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.

Ponsonby26, where extra \nwages were deemed sufficient consideration once the crew's obligation changed. \nUnderstanding these principles helps clarify the nature of contracts and the \nimportance of consideration in ensuring enforceability. \n \n5. INTENTION TO ENTER LEGAL RELATIONS \nThe intention to create legal relations, also referred to as “intention to be legally \nbound,” is a fundamental doctrine in contract law, particularly within English contract law \nand similar common law jurisdictions. This intention is a necessary and independent element \nin forming a valid contract, serving as a threshold requirement across all types of contracts. \nThe general principle dictates that a contract formed with valuable consideration will \nnot be enforced unless both parties explicitly intend to be legally bound. Essentially, this \nmeans that each party is prepared to accept the legal consequences of failing to fulfil their \nobligations. For an offer to be considered binding upon acceptance, it must be communicated \nin a manner that reasonably suggests an intention to create legal consequences. Therefore, the \nintention to enter into legal relations becomes a critical criterion that determines the \nenforceability of a contract. In the absence of this intention, no binding contract exists since a \ncontract, as defined by Treitel, is “an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced \nor recognised by law.”27 \nThe assessment of this intention uses an objective test, meaning it is judged by how a \nreasonable person would interpret the conduct of the involved parties, not their personal \nfeelings or internal motives. To identify whether there is a contractual intention in different \nagreements, one must carefully examine the nature of those agreements. \nIn the realm of domestic and social arrangements, there exists a rebuttable \npresumption that the parties do not intend to create legal relations. Such agreements, often \ndeemed “engagements” as referenced in Professor Sagay’s Nigerian Law of Contract28, are \ntypically seen as informal and lacking in legal intention. Domestic agreements, which pertain \nto familial arrangements or those made in a social context, illustrate a clear distinction \n \n26 Hartley v Ponsonby (1857) 7 El & Bl 872, 119 ER 1471 \n27Ibid, p. 1 \n28 See n 1, supra, p. 140-142 \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \nbetween a mere agreement and a legally enforceable contract. These agreements often stem \nfrom moral rather than legal obligations. \nFor example, when married couples living together reaches an understanding, courts \npresume that there is no intention to form a contractual relationship, and thus, parties cannot \nsue one another based on these agreements. Similarly, social agreements- those based on \nfriendships or close acquaintances- are also presumed not to carry legally binding intentions. \nA notable case illustrating this principle is Balfour v. Balfour29, in which a civil \nservant promised his wife a monthly allowance of £30 while working in Ceylon. When he \nfailed to make the payment, his wife sued him for enforcement. The Court of Appeal found \nthis arrangement to be merely domestic; therefore, no contract existed as the parties did not \nintend for the arrangement to be legally binding. Such family arrangements are based on \ngood faith rather than legal enforceability. \nNevertheless, this presumption can be rebutted under certain circumstances. For \ninstance, in Meritt v. Meritt30, after a separation between a husband and wife, they agreed that \nhe would pay her £40 a month, allowing her to pay off the mortgage on their home. After \nfulfilling her responsibility, he refused to transfer the house to her. The court ruled the \nagreement binding, stating that the presumption of absence of contractual intention does not \napply when:  \n● The couple is no longer living amicably or has separated. \n● The agreement is documented in writing, or, \n● One party has made significant sacrifices at the other’s request, as seen in Parker v. \nClark. \nThese are the scenarios where contractual intention in domestic agreements may be deemed \nlegally binding. \nIn contrast, commercial agreements are characterised by a strong presumption of \ncontractual intention. Courts generally interpret agreements made within a commercial \ncontext as legally binding. This presumption empowers parties in such agreements to pursue \nlegal action in the event of a breach. The robustness of this presumption is such that \n \n29 Balfour v. Balfour [1919] 2 K. B. 571 \n30 Merritt v. Merrit [1970] 1 WLR 1211 \n \nP a g e  | 14 \n \nchallenges regarding the validity of commercial agreements on the grounds of lacking \ncontractual intention are exceedingly rare. \nHowever, the presumption can be displaced where the parties declares an absence of \ncontractual intention through the use of honor clauses and mere puffs. Where an agreement \ncontains a clause that expressly excludes the contractual intention of parties, the presumption \nthat commercial arrangements will give rise to legal relations may be rebutted by such \nevidence. See the foreign case of Rose and Frank Co. V. Crumpton Bros(1923).31  In Nigeria, \nthe “honour clause” are all centred on football pool arrangements between stakers and the \npools companies. There is always a clause in football coupons stating that; all arrangements \nwill not give rise to legal relations or litigation but are binding in honour only, as seen in the \ncase of Amadi v. Pool House Group and Nigerian Pools Co.32 \nMere puffs occurs where parties assert that their promise was not intended to be \ntaken seriously or literally. Moreso, in the  case of Weekes v. Tybald,33 the defendant said in a \nconversation that he would give 100 Pounds to anyone who married his daughter with his \nconsent. The plaintiff married the defendant’s daughter with his(defendant’s) consent and \nafterwards sued to claim the 100 pounds when the defendant failed to pay him. The action \nfailed and it was established that the defendant’s promise was a mere puff without any \nintentions to be bound. In such situations, court uses the “test of a reasonable man” to \ndetermine whether such promise is a mere puff or not.  \nAlthough all commercial agreements are presumed to have contractual intentions \ninherent in them, strict attention must be given to the situations surrounding the agreements \nin order to know the actual intentions of parties to the agreement. \n6. CAPACITY TO CONTRACT \n \nCapacity to contract is a fundamental principle in Nigerian contract law, ensuring that \nparties possess the legal competence necessary to understand and engage in contractual \nobligations. This analysis explores the concept of capacity to contract through the lens of the \nSupreme Court ruling in A.R.M.C. Ltd v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd. The court's decision affirmed \nthat a valid contract was formed based on the essential elements of offer, acceptance, and \nconsideration, even in the absence of a signed formal agreement. This paper will delve into \n \n31 [1925] A. C. 445.  \n32 [1966] 2 All N.L.R. 254.  \n33 (1605) Noy 11. \n \nP a g e  | 15 \n \nthe role of capacity in contracts, potential challenges to its validity, and its implications \nwithin the context of the case. \nCapacity to contract refers to the legal ability of parties to enter into binding \nagreements, which necessitates that individuals (or entities) are of sound mind, of legal age, \nand not barred by law from contracting, such as minors, individuals suffering from mental \nincapacities, intoxicated persons, or those under legal disabilities. In the ruling of A.R.M.C. \nLtd v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd, the Supreme Court stated that “all the essential elements of a \ncontract are autonomous and equal in the sense that each of them must be present for a valid \nand binding contract to exist”34. Competence in contracting is an implicit prerequisite; a \ncontract lacking competent consent is fundamentally flawed. \nIn this case, both the Appellant (A.R.M.C. Ltd) and the Respondents (Elizade Nigeria \nLtd) were corporate entities governed by the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) \n2020, specifically section 35, which grants registered companies the capacity to enter into \ncontracts as long as their actions align with their memorandum and articles of association. \nThe case established that A.R.M.C. Ltd, through its authorised representatives, offered to sell \napproximately 38 million shares in July 2008, with Elizade Nigeria Ltd accepting the offer \nunconditionally and paying in full. This suggests prima facie capacity, as corporate actions \nare typically executed by boards or authorised agents acting within their delegated powers. \nHowever, a thorough examination of capacity within a corporate framework \nnecessitates consideration of the authority with which representatives operate. Under Sec 63 \nof CAMA 202035, a company's board of directors must authorise significant transactions like \nshare sales to ensure the company does not exceed its capacity. If A.R.M.C. Ltd.’s offer was \nissued by an unauthorised agent, the contract could be deemed voidable due to ultra vires \nactions, as established in Okeowo v. Migliore36. Similarly, while Elizade Nigeria Ltd.’s \nacceptance and payment imply board approval, any influence of misrepresentation or duress \ncould potentially challenge their informed consent and thus raise questions about their \ncapacity to contract. However, since no such challenges were raised, the internal governance \nstructures of both corporations appeared to support their competence. \n \n34 See n. 1, supra \n35 Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020, s. 63 \n36Okeowo v Migliore [1979] 11 NSCC 348. \n \nP a g e  | 16 \n \nThe Supreme Court's emphasis on offer, acceptance, and consideration underscores a \npresumption of intact capacity. The Respondents’ refusal to sign the draft agreement and \nsubsequent retraction, citing undisclosed encumbrances, focused on the contractual terms \nrather than questioning competency, reinforcing the assumption that both entities and their \nrepresentatives were legally capable. \nThe absence of challenges to capacity in A.R.M.C. Ltd v. Elizade Nigeria Ltd. reflects \nits assumed presence as a vital contractual element. Nonetheless, a more profound \nexploration reveals its critical role in the court's reasoning. Had capacity been contested, \nvarious scenarios could have influenced the outcome: \n● Ultra vires acts: If A.R.M.C. Ltd.’s offer exceeded its authorised powers (for \ninstance, selling shares without board approval), the contract would be voidable under \nCAMA 2020, Sec 6537. This principle aligns with the precedent set in A.G. Federation \nv. Abubakar38, where the court’s validation indicates A.R.M.C. Ltd.’s offer was within \nits corporate capacity. \n● Misrepresentation or duress: If Elizade Nigeria Ltd.’s acceptance had been coerced \nby fraudulent misrepresentation or undue pressure, this could potentially impair their \nability to consent, rendering the contract voidable under common law principles, as \nnoted in Solanke v. Abed39. The Respondents' retraction, grounded on encumbrances \nrather than claims of incapacity, illustrates that there were no significant challenges to \nthe parties' legal competence. \n \n7. RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF A CONTRACT \n \nHaving understood the essential elements of a contract, the question of “which \nelement is the most essential?” arises. It is an impossible question as each element of a \ncontract, while independent from one another, plays equal significance in the formation of a \nvalid contract. The absence of just one element will make a contract void. Let us now delve \ninto the interdependence of these elements on one another. \n \n37 See n. 10, s. 65 \n38 A.G. Federation v. Abubakar [2007] 10 NWLR (Pt. 1041) 1 \n39 Solanke v Abed [1962] 1 All NLR 115 \n \nP a g e  | 17 \n \nEvery valid contract begins with an offer- a clear proposal to perform an action (or \nrefrain from doing so)- with the expectation that it will become binding upon acceptance. \nHowever, not every expression qualifies as an offer. \nIn the landmark case, Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co40, the company offered £100 \nto anyone who used their product and still contracted the flu. When Mrs. Carlill used the \nproduct as directed and fell ill, she claimed the reward. The court ruled this constituted a \nvalid offer to the public, with her use of the product serving as an unequivocal acceptance. \nIn contrast, the case of Fisher v Bell41 saw a shopkeeper displaying a flick knife in his \nshop window. The court determined this was not an offer but rather an invitation to treat- \nessentially, a signal for customers to make their offers to buy. \nFurthermore, acceptance must precisely mirror the original offer. In Gibson v \nManchester City Council42, the council's statement that it “may be prepared to sell” a house \nwas deemed too vague for acceptance, resulting in no binding contract. Thus, for a contract to \nform, there must be a clear offer and a corresponding acceptance, devoid of ambiguity and \nuncertainty. \nFor a contract to be enforceable, it must include consideration, meaning each party \nmust provide something of value. This does not always have to be monetary; it could involve \na service, an act, or even a promise. However, it must be exchanged as part of the agreement. \nIn Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co43, Mrs. Carlill’s use of the smoke ball as directed \nserved as valid consideration. Notably, past actions are not counted as consideration- once a \npromise is made, only new acts can contribute to it. This principle underscores the necessity \nof consideration: transforming a casual promise into a binding agreement where both parties \nbenefit. \nEven if there is an offer, acceptance, and consideration, a contract will not be legally \nenforceable unless both parties intended to establish a binding agreement.  \nIn Balfour v Balfour44, a husband’s promise to send money to his wife while they \nwere apart was found unenforceable, as the court determined that domestic agreements \n \n40 See n. 15, supra \n41 Fisher v Bell [1961] 1 QB 394. \n42 Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] 1 WLR 294. \n43 See n. 16, supra \n44 See n. 8, supra \n \nP a g e  | 18 \n \ntypically lack legal intent. Conversely, in Welch v Jess (1976), two friends who agreed to split \nprize money from a fishing competition were protected by the court when one failed to \nhonour the agreement, illustrating that legal intention can be inferred if both parties treat the \nagreement seriously. \nA well-formed agreement requires that all parties possess the legal capacity to \ncontract. This means they must be of sound mind, free from duress, and typically of legal age. \nCase law, including Amadi v Obiajunwa (2016) in Nigerian law, underscores that a lack of \ncapacity- such as being a minor or mentally incapacitated- can render a contract void or \nvoidable. Thus, everyone involved must fully understand and agree to the terms of the \ncontract. \nConsider the elements of a valid contract as ingredients in a recipe: omit one, and the entire \ndish may fail. A valid offer and acceptance build the agreement. Consideration adds essential \nvalue. Intention reflects the seriousness of the parties involved. Capacity ensures all parties \ncan legally engage in the contract. \nIn Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co, the advertisement constituted a valid offer; Mrs. \nCarlill’s use of the product demonstrated acceptance and valid consideration, while the \ncompany’s £100 deposit indicated legal intent, and all parties could contract. In contrast, Rose \n& Frank v Crompton45 revealed that an agreement without intent to create legal obligations \ncannot be enforced, despite initial consensus. \nUltimately, a valid contract requires all these elements to work harmoniously. Each \ncomponent supports the others, like interlocking gears in a machine. If one part falters, the \nentire mechanism may fail, which is why courts scrutinise how each element interacts when \ndetermining a contract’s binding nature. \n \n8. CONCLUSION \n \nIn conclusion, the essential elements of a valid contract in Nigerian law, as \nunderscored by the court's decision in A.R.M.C. Ltd. v Elizade Nigeria Ltd., are indeed \nautonomous and equal, each playing a pivotal role in the formation and enforceability of \n \n45 Rose and Frank Co. v Crompton & Bros Ltd. [1925] AC 445. \n \n \nP a g e  | 19 \n \ncontractual agreements. The absence of any one of these elements can have profound \nimplications, potentially rendering a contract void or voidable. As commercial transactions \ncontinue to evolve and become increasingly complex, adherence to these foundational \nprinciples is crucial for ensuring the integrity and efficacy of contractual relationships. By \nrigorously applying these elements, parties can safeguard their interests, minimise disputes, \nand foster a stable commercial environment. Ultimately, the meticulous attention to these \ncontractual essentials not only upholds the sanctity of contract but also promotes confidence \nand predictability in business dealings, which are indispensable for economic growth and \ndevelopment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 20 \n \n9.

Contract as a concept can be viewed in various \nways but in this context, we would be discussing contract in the legal sense. \nIn law, different legal scholars have defined the concept of contract in various methods, \none of those definitions is the definition given by Galadinma J.C.A. in the case Kabo Air v. \nTarfa. Here, the honourable Judge views contract as “an agreement which is legally binding on \nthe parties to it and which, if broken, may be enforced by action in court against the defaulting \nparty.” In the same spirit of the law, Fabiyi J.C.A. in Oyewole v. Lawal defined contract in line \nwith the Black Law Dictionary as “an agreement between two or more persons which creates an \nobligation to do or not to do a particular thing”. It is essentially a promise or a set of promises \nfor the breach of which the law provides a remedy, or the performance of which the law \nrecognizes as a duty. For an agreement to be considered a valid contract, it must typically contain \nseveral key elements, including an offer, acceptance, consideration, an intention to create legal \nrelations, and capacity to contract. \nAll of these buttress on the need of two major things. First being the agreement and \nsecond is binding ability. A contract is an agreement because it entails the decisions and \npromises of contracting parties which is well derived when both of their minds meet which is \ncalled Consensus Ad Idem. The presence of this Consensus Ad Idem guarantees the mutual \nagreement of both parties and this makes such an agreement a binding contract on both parties. \nConsensus Ad Idem is not about the parties' subjective, inner thoughts but rather their objective \nintentions as manifested by their words and conduct. A court will assess whether a reasonable \nperson would conclude, from the parties' communications, that they had a common \nunderstanding of the agreement's terms. This principle ensures that parties are not bound by an \nagreement they did not genuinely intend to enter into and that there is a genuine basis for the \nrights and obligations that arise from the contract. Without this meeting of minds, we can infer to \nsay that there was no agreement in such instance.  \nThe Principle of Consensus Ad Idem was majorly pointed out in the case of Shonubi v. \nOnafeko, where the court found that the parties had different understandings of the agreement \nthey entered into, which literally translate to the absence of no meeting of minds and therefore no \nenforceable or binding contract. The honourable Judge held that “Consensus ad idem is germane \nto any contract which will be enforceable by law. Thus, 'one thing’ is common to all these \ntransactions and that is the existence of an agreement which will enable the enforcement of \nrights and obligations between the parties.’’ \nThe phrase, \"...‘one thing’ is common to all these transactions and that is the existence of \nan agreement...\" emphasizes that the existence of an agreement is the unifying element in all \nvalid contractual dealings. No matter the type of transaction — whether it’s buying goods, hiring \nservices, leasing property, etc. — there must be an agreement that reflects the intention of the \nparties to be legally bound by their promises. \"...which will enable the enforcement of rights and \nobligations between the parties.\" This further highlights that once there is a clear agreement, the \nlaw will recognize it and allow each party to enforce their respective rights and obligations under \nthat contract. \n \n \nConsensus ad idem means that all the parties involved understand and agree to the same \nterms of a contract. If one party misunderstands a key part of the agreement, there is no \nconsensus ad idem, and therefore, no binding contract. Consensus ad idem refers to the \nfundamental requirement in contract law that for a legally binding contract to be formed, all \nparties involved must have a clear, mutual understanding and agreement on the essential terms \nand subject matter of the agreement. It means that both parties are not just agreeing, but they are \nagreeing to the same thing in the same sense. \nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria in Best (Nigeria) Ltd. v. Blackwood Hodge (Nigeria) Ltd \nhad held that \"Consensus ad idem is the very foundation of any binding contract. It means that \nthe parties to a contract must be in agreement as to the terms and subject matter of the contract.\" \n The Supreme Court of Nigeria of Nigeria also in U.B.N. v. Ozigi had defined consensus ad idem \nalso to mean: \"There must be a meeting of the minds, that is, consensus ad idem, before a \ncontract can be said to exist between parties.\" \n \n \n \n \n \nCONCENSUS AD IDEM IN THE FORMATION OF A CONTRACT AND HOW LACK \nOF IT MIGHT LEAD TO VOID/NON ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT \nConsensus ad idem is mostly reflected in the acceptance of an offer without any changes \nbeing made in the initial offer. This phrase of Consensus ad idem originated from the fact that \ncontracts are rendered void if the parties are not on the same tangent when it comes to terms and \nconditions that constitute a contract. For a contract to be valid, the parties must intend to enter \ninto a legally binding agreement. Consensus ad idem ensures that all parties shares the same \nunderstanding and intent. If there is ambiguity or misunderstanding about the terms (e.g., the \nidentity of the goods or services), it may mean consensus ad idem was not achieved, rendering \nthe contract void or voidable. All kinds of perplexities shall be avoided in the terms of the \ncontract and shall not be subject to any ambiguity. \nMeeting of minds is therefore very necessary. It does not completely eradicate the \npossibility of difference in opinion but simply means that all the different opinions shall be \nclearly discussed and accommodated in a manner that does not overlook the interests of all \nparties to a contract. It focuses on the removal of any sort of confusion that may, later on, lead to \nconflicts. Hence, mutual agreement is essential to keep away any conflicting situation that may \narise from a misunderstanding when the contract was formulated. For example, if A agrees to \nsell a \"Jaguar\" to B, but A means the animal while B believes it’s a car; there is no consensus ad \nidem, and thus, no valid contract. \nIn Union Bank of Nigeria Ltd v. Ajabule, the Supreme Court held that meeting of the \nminds is a fundamental prerequisite for the formation of any valid contract. Even if documents \nare signed, there is no contract unless there is mutual consent. \nWithout consensus ad idem, there is no real agreement to enforce. Courts often use this principle \nto determine whether a true contract exists or whether the parties were simply negotiating or \nmisunderstanding each other. \nLack of consensus ad idem causes contracts to be void ab initio (from the beginning), or \nunenforceable, since no true agreement existed. \nIn the case of Raffles v. Wichelhaus, there was ambiguity about an essential term which \ninvalidated the contract. There was no consensus ad idem because both parties had different \nships in mind. \n \n \nJUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND DECIDED CASES \nThe case of Shonubi v. Onafeko serves as an instructive example of the judiciary’s \napproach to this doctrine. The facts revealed that the appellant alleged the existence of a binding \nagreement with the respondent regarding the sale of land. However, discrepancies in the \nunderstanding and intentions of both parties led the court to conclude that there was no true \nmeeting of minds. The Court held that mere negotiations or subjective beliefs do not establish a \nvalid contract in law; what is required is clear, objective mutual assent. The decision reaffirms \nthe position that the courts will only enforce obligations that arise from a definite and mutual \nagreement. \nThe requirement of consensus ad idem is not unique to Nigerian jurisprudence but is a \nwell-established principle in common law jurisdictions. A prominent illustration can be found in \nthe classic English case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893) 1 QB 256. In that case, the \ncourt enforced a contract formed by the company’s public advertisement and Mrs. Carlill’s \ncompliance with its terms. The court found that a valid offer had been made and accepted, \ndemonstrating both intention and mutual agreement. This case illustrates that where the parties’ \nintentions and understanding coincide, a valid contract is formed, irrespective of its formality. \nSimilarly, in Balogun v. University of Abuja (2002) 13 NWLR (Pt. 783) 379, the \nNigerian Court of Appeal was faced with a claim based on an alleged contractual relationship \nbetween a student and the university. The university had offered admission, which was later \nwithdrawn. The plaintiff argued that this withdrawal amounted to a breach of contract. However, \nthe court found that no enforceable contract existed because the terms of admission had not \ncrystallized into binding obligations. The judgment affirmed that without mutuality of \nunderstanding and intention, contractual liability cannot arise. \nThe importance of clarity and mutual assent was also central to the case of Harvela \nInvestments Ltd v. Royal Trust Co. of Canada (1986) AC 207. In that case, the House of Lords \ndealt with competing bids for the purchase of shares. One party submitted a referential bid, \nwhich created ambiguity regarding the acceptance of the offer. The court held that such \nambiguity undermined the certainty required for consensus and therefore invalidated the \nagreement. This decision reinforces the point that the mutual understanding required for \ncontractual agreement must be precise and unequivocal. \nIn R v. Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227, the High Court of Australia dealt with a situation \nwhere the claimant gave information to the authorities but had not, at the time, intended to accept \na reward offer. The court ruled that since the claimant was not acting in reliance on the offer \nwhen he provided the information, there was no true acceptance. This case highlights that a valid \ncontract demands not only an offer and acceptance, but also the intention to be bound by the \nagreement at the relevant time. This further supports the idea that consensus requires both \nsubjective and objective alignment between the parties. \nAnother illustrative Nigerian case is Odutola v. Papersack Nigeria Ltd (2006) 18 NWLR \n(Pt. 1012) 470, where the Supreme Court found that a valid lease agreement existed between the \nparties. The evidence showed that both parties had reached a clear agreement on the terms and \nhad acted upon them. The court upheld the enforceability of the contract, emphasizing that \nmutual assent, coupled with performance or reliance, creates a binding obligation under the law. \nThe decision aligns with the enduring requirement that enforceability hinges on the existence of \nconsensus ad idem. \nTaken together, these cases demonstrate that consensus ad idem is more than a theoretical \nabstraction — it is a practical requirement that lies at the heart of contractual relationships. It \nensures that obligations are not imposed unilaterally or based on vague understandings, but on \nshared, intentional commitments. The Nigerian courts, like their common law counterparts, have \nconsistently insisted that unless both parties are clearly and objectively in agreement, no contract \ncan be deemed valid or enforceable. \n \nIMPORTANCE OF CONSENSUS AD IDEM IN ENFORCING RIGHTS AND DUTIES \nConsensus ad idem also known as meeting of minds is a fundamental principle in law of \ncontract that ensures all parties involved in an agreement understand and agree to the same terms \nand conditions. If there is no mutual agreement between parties, then there is no valid contract.  \n   \nConsensus ad idem is essential because a contract is only valid if the parties reach a \nmutual agreement on the terms. Without consensus ad idem, there can be no legally binding \ncontract, making it possible to enforce rights or obligations. \n  \nAlso, when all parties have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, disputes are \nminimized. This makes sure that duties are performed as intended and rights are respected. \nIn addition, the rights and duties of each party are defined by the terms agreed upon. If \nthere is no consensus, it is challenging for courts to enforce any rights or obligations since the \nactual agreement remains unclear. \n Furthermore, consensus ad idem protects against coercion or misrepresentation by \nensuring that the agreement was entered into willingly and with full understanding. \n \nTHE EFFECT OF AMBIGUITY, MISTAKE OR MISREPRESENTATION ON \nCONSENSUS IN CONTRACT LAW \nIn the Nigerian law of contract, the principle of consensus ad idem meaning a true \nmeeting of the minds is fundamental to the validity of any agreement. As emphasized by Sagay \nin his authoritative work Nigerian Law of Contract, any factor that distorts or impairs the free \nand informed consent of parties undermines the foundation of a contract. Among the most \ncommon threats to consensus are ambiguity, mistake, and misrepresentation. Each introduces an \nelement of misunderstanding or deception that can render a contract void or voidable, depending \non its nature and severity. \n \n1.  Ambiguity and Its Impact on Consensus \nAmbiguity occurs when the language of a contract is vague or susceptible to multiple \ninterpretations, making it difficult to ascertain the true intentions of the parties. According to \nSagay, for a contract to be valid, its terms must be clear, certain, and mutually understood. When \nambiguity affects key elements such as the subject matter, consideration, or obligations of the \nparties, it casts doubt on whether there was ever a  genuine agreement. \nCourts generally strive to interpret contracts in a manner that preserves their validity. However, \nwhere the ambiguity is so fundamental that it obscures the purpose or terms of the agreement, the \ncourt may declare the contract void for uncertainty. In such cases, the lack of clarity directly \nundermines the existence of consensus ad idem. \n2. Mistake and Its Effect on Consensus \nA mistake in contract law refers to a  misunderstanding or incorrect belief held by one or \nboth parties at the time the agreement was formed. Sagay categorizes mistakes into three types: \ncommon, mutual, and unilateral each with distinct implications for consensus. \nA common mistake arises when both parties are mistaken about the same essential fact. For \ninstance, if both parties enter into a contract for the sale of goods that have unknowingly \nperished, the contract is void, as there is no real agreement on an existing subject matter. \nA mutual mistake occurs when the parties misunderstand each other’s intentions, resulting in \na situation where each party believes they are agreeing to something different. Such a \nmisunderstanding may nullify consensus if it affects a material term of the contract. \nA unilateral mistake, where only one party is mistaken, typically does not void a contract unless \nthe other party knew of the mistake and sought to exploit it. In such cases, equity may intervene \nto prevent unjust outcomes. \nSagay asserts that the critical test for determining whether a mistake undermines \nconsensus is whether the mistake defeats the intention of the parties to enter into the same \ncontract on the same terms. \n \n3. Misrepresentation and Its Effect on Consensus  \nMisrepresentation involves a false statement of fact made by one party that induces another \nto enter into a contract. Sagay identifies three types of misrepresentation: fraudulent, negligent, \nand innocent. Regardless of its form, misrepresentation distorts the informed consent of the \nmisled party, thereby affecting the validity of the contract. \nWhen a contract is based on misrepresentation, the apparent consensus is flawed because one \nparty’s decision was influenced by false information. While misrepresentation may not render a \ncontract void, it typically makes it voidable at the instance of the party who was misled. This \nmeans the injured party has the right to rescind the contract and, in certain cases, claim damages \nespecially where the misrepresentation was fraudulent or negligent. \nSagay emphasizes that true consent cannot exist where deception or false belief forms the basis \nof a party’s agreement. \nIn summary, ambiguity, mistake, and misrepresentation are significant factors that \nundermine the essential requirement of consensus in contract law. As Sagay articulates, \nconsensus ad idem is not just about apparent agreement but about a genuine, informed, and \nvoluntary meeting of the minds. When this consensus is compromised whether by unclear terms, \nmutual misunderstanding, or deceptive statements the validity of the contract is at risk. By \naddressing these issues carefully during contract formation, parties can ensure that their \nagreements are not only enforceable but also grounded in true and mutual understanding. \n \n \nHOW THE ABOVE MENTIONED AFFECT THE PRINCIPLES OF CERTAINTY, \nFAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION \nThe validity and enforceability of any contract rest on three core legal principles: justice, \nfairness, and certainty. These principles not only safeguard the rights of contracting parties but \nalso preserve the integrity of the legal system. According to Sagay in Nigerian Law of Contract, \nwhen elements such as ambiguity, mistake, or misrepresentation are present, they threaten these \nfoundational values and may render a contract void or voidable. \n \n1. Certainty \nCertainty requires that the terms of a contract be clear, precise, and understandable. Contracts \nmust reflect a mutual and definite agreement to ensure that obligations are enforceable and \nexpectations are aligned. \nAmbiguity directly undermines certainty. When the language of a contract is vague or open \nto multiple interpretations, it becomes difficult to establish whether the parties were ever truly in \nagreement. Sagay notes that a contract lacking clear terms may be void for uncertainty, as courts \ncannot enforce obligations they cannot confidently interpret. \nSimilarly, a mistake particularly where it is mutual or common suggests that the parties were \nnever on the same page regarding essential terms. Such misunderstandings erode the clarity \nrequired for contractual certainty and may nullify the agreement altogether. \n \n2. Fairness \nThe principle of fairness ensures that all parties enter a contract voluntarily, with full \nknowledge of the material facts, and without deception or undue influence. Fairness demands \nthat contracts be based on truth and mutual benefit. \nMisrepresentation strikes at the heart of fairness. Whether fraudulent, negligent, or innocent, \nit distorts the reality upon which a party consents to a contract. Sagay emphasizes that where \nconsent is obtained through misrepresentation, the resulting agreement is voidable because it \nlacks true voluntariness and equity. \nThe law intervenes to uphold fairness by providing remedies such as rescission or damages, \nenabling the injured party to escape the unfair consequences of being misled. \n \n \n3.  Justice \nJustice in contract law refers to the equitable treatment of parties and the enforcement of \nagreements in accordance with the true intentions of those involved. It also implies that no party \nshould unjustly benefit at the expense of another. \nEnforcing a contract tainted by mistake, ambiguity, or misrepresentation can lead to unjust \noutcomes. For instance, compelling a party to perform a contract based on a fundamental \nmisunderstanding or false representation would be contrary to the dictates of justice. \nIn cases of ambiguity, justice may require that unclear terms be interpreted against the party \nwho introduced or benefited from the vagueness—a principle known as the contra proferentem \nrule. \nIn summary, the presence of ambiguity, mistake, or misrepresentation significantly \ncompromises the core principles of certainty, fairness, and justice that underpin valid contractual \nrelationships. As Sagay rightly observes, the law does not enforce agreements for their own sake \nbut insists that they be rooted in genuine, informed, and voluntary consensus. Upholding these \nprinciples ensures that contractual obligations are not only legally binding but also morally and \nsocially acceptable \n \nIn conclusion, consensus ad idem is the cornerstone of every valid and enforceable contract. \nIt represents the mutual understanding and agreement between parties on the essential terms of \ntheir arrangement. Without this meeting of minds, there is no true agreement—only assumptions, \nmisunderstandings, or mere negotiations that cannot give rise to legal obligations. \nThe Nigerian courts, supported by common law principles, have consistently upheld this \ndoctrine as fundamental to the integrity of contractual relationships. Through cases like Shonubi \nv. Onafeko, UBN v. Ozigi, and Raffles v. Wichelhaus, it is clear that where consensus is absent, \na contract either does not exist or is void ab initio. \nTo encapsulate its importance: consensus ad idem is to contract law what a foundation is to a \nbuilding—without it, the entire structure collapses. It is the legal assurance that the rights and \nduties being enforced are rooted in a clear, mutual, and deliberate understanding. \nThus, the principle is not merely procedural but central to the values of certainty, fairness, \nand justice, ensuring that contractual obligations are not only binding, but equitable and \nlegitimate. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.

Acceptance by Post. \nConclusion. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION: \nIn the ordinary course of life, agreements are constantly made,some in words, others in \nsilence, and many through actions. Yet not every promise binds, and not every agreement \nholds legal force. What transforms a mere offer into an obligation is not just the intention \nto promise, but the response it receives. That response,the point where one mind meets \nanother,is what gives life to a contract. Without it, the law has nothing to enforce. \nLet us first of all consider what a contract is. \nA contract is an agreement which the law will enforce or recognize as affecting the legal \nrights and duties of the parties. It is a promise or set of promises which the law will \nenforce. In the case of Kano Air v. Tarfa, Galadinma J.C.A held that \n“a contract must be an agreement which is legally binding on the parties to it, and \nwhich, if broken, may be enforced by action in court against the defaulting party.” \nA valid contract must require the following essentials: Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, \nand Intention to create legal relations. For the purpose of this work, acceptance will only \nbe considered. \nAcceptance is the unqualified agreement by the offeree (the person to whom an offer is \nmade) to the terms of the offer, creating a binding contract when communicated to the \nofferor. Essentially, acceptance signifies a \"meeting of the minds” consensus ad \nidem—where both parties agree to the terms of the exchange without equivocation or \nambiguity. What constitutes the acceptance of an offer was given a comprehensive \ndefinition by Tobi J.C.A in Orient Bank (Nig) Plc v. Bilante International Ltd. \nIn a bilateral contract, the element of acceptance is crucial because it signifies the mutual \nagreement between two parties to be bound by the terms of the contract. This agreement \nis established when the offeree (the party receiving the offer) communicates their \nunconditional agreement to the offeror (the party making the offer). This exchange of \npromises is what makes the contract bilateral, with both parties obligated to fulfill their \nrespective commitments. \n \nBefore we move into discussing what are the valid modes of acceptance, let us briefly \nlook at what does not constitute a valid mode of acceptance. \n(i) Counter Offer: \nThis was elaborated by Tobi J.C.A in Orient Bank Nig. Plc v. Bilante International \nLtd: \n“For an acceptance to be operative, it must be plain, unequivocal, unconditional \nand without variance of any sort between it and the offer. The offeree must \nunreservedly assent to the exact terms proposed by the offeror. A counter offer or \na qualified acceptance of an offer cannot give rise to a binding agreement between \nthe parties.” \n(ii) Conditional Acceptance: \nA conditional acceptance is not a valid or binding acceptance. Any acceptance which is \nmade subject to a condition cannot create a binding contract until that condition has been \nmet or fulfilled.Thus, in Winn v. Bull, it was held that in the absence of a formal contract, \nthe agreement was not binding. \n(iii) Cross Offers: \nA cross offer does not constitute a valid acceptance. There has to be consensus ad idem. \nThis is discussed in Tinn v. Hoffmann. \n(iv) Acceptance in Ignorance of the Offer: \nAn acceptance made in ignorance of the offer is not an acceptance at all. This is discussed \nin the cases of Gibbons v. Proctor and R v. Clarke. \nWhen an act coincides with the requirements contained in an offer, it is not an acceptance \nif the person doing the act was not aware of the existence of the offer at the time he \nperformed the act. However, once this prior knowledge exists, motive or intention is \nirrelevant \n \nAn acceptance must be communicated otherwise it will not be valid . Not only that , the \ncommunication must be in such a form that it can be objectively determined. \nWe shall now discuss the valid modes of acceptance which are :: \n(a) by the conduct of the parties \n(b) by their words \n(c) by documents that have passed between them \n(d) by post \nA. ACCEPTANCE BY CONDUCT OF THE PARTIES \nAcceptance by conduct refers to situations where an individual’s actions, rather than their \nwords, demonstrate their agreement to the terms of an offer. This type of acceptance \nhinges on the idea that a person's behavior can be just as binding as a verbal or written \nagreement. The key to identifying acceptance by conduct lies in observing actions \nindicating acceptance—whether these actions clearly show an intention to agree to the \noffer's conditions. \nIn Orient Bank (Nig.) Plc. v. Bilante International Ltd, Tobi J.C.A, as he then was, \ndescribed the various ways in which acceptance may be manifested, one which \nacceptance by conduct is one of them (the conduct of the parties). \nAcceptance by conduct occurs when the offeree clearly performs an act with the intention \nof accepting the offer. \nIn contract law, this type of acceptance allows for the formation of contracts even when \nexplicit acceptance may not have been stated. Parties can enter into legally binding \nagreements by demonstrating their intention to accept an offer through their conduct or \nactions. \nThis type of acceptance comes in various forms within contract law. Here is an example: \n \n●​ Continuing to use a service after being informed of changes in terms and \nconditions can imply acceptance of those changes \nFor conduct to constitute acceptance, it must fulfill two requirements: awareness and \nknowledge. The conduct must be clearly done, mental or internal acceptance is not \nenough. \nGenerally, the offeree’s silence cannot equal acceptance. Silence is not clear enough a \nresponse to lead to a valid acceptance (Felthouse v Bindley (1862) (Court of Common \nPleas)). \nIn Felthouse v. Bindley, an uncle offered to buy his nephew's horse, stating that silence \nwould mean acceptance. The nephew intended to sell the horse but did not reply. The \nhorse was mistakenly sold at auction by Bindley. The court held that there was no binding \ncontract, as silence cannot amount to acceptance. Communication of acceptance is \nessential in contract law. \nMoreover, the person performing the act must be aware of the offer in the first place. This \nprinciple was established in Fitch v. Snedaker, where the plaintiff gave information that \nled to solving a murder but was unaware of a reward at the time. He later tried to claim \nthe reward. The court ruled against him, holding that you must know of an offer to accept \nit. A reward cannot be claimed if the act was done without knowledge of the offer. \nAcceptance by conduct, which is one of the ways in which acceptance may be \nmanifested, is an area where care must be taken, as a person's conduct may be mistaken \nas acceptance even without actual knowledge of the offer. \n \nLegal Effect of Acceptance by Conduct \n \nAcceptance by conduct is a legally binding form of agreement. Even without a signature \nor verbal consent, courts may recognize a contract if one party performs according to the \noffer’s terms and the other party knowingly benefits from that performance. \n \nThe enforceability hinges on several core elements: \n●​ Clear conduct that reflects the terms of the offer. \n●​ Knowledge of the offer by the party performing the conduct. \n●​ Mutual intent to enter a legal relationship. \nFor example, if a vendor delivers goods per an unsigned contract and the recipient uses \nthe goods without objection, this may constitute acceptance by conduct. The key is that \nthe conduct aligns with the offer and is not merely coincidental. \n \nCase Examples \n1.In the 2015 case of Reveille Independent LLC vs. Anotech International, the \ntelevision company sued the UK cookware company for breach of contract. Reveille \nclaimed that it had licensed intellectual property (IP) rights to Anotech and agreed to \npromote their products on their TV show Master Chef, in exchange for an agreed-upon \nsum. \nThe case hinged upon a signed deal memo that was marked with \"brand conflict with \nGordon Ramsay to be concluded and other minor amendments.\" This document was not \nsigned by both parties and stated within that it would thus not be legally binding. \nNegotiations between the party broke down, so this memo was never replaced with an \nofficially signed agreement. Reveille then notified the defendant that the memo \nconstituted a contract and sued for breach of contract for failure to pay. \nIn response, the defendant claimed that because the deal memo was not signed, no legally \nbinding contract was in effect. They noted that the contract was subject to a condition \nprecedent as indicated on the original deal memo. \nThe court determined that the memo constituted a binding contract for the reason of \ncontract acceptance by conduct. In effect, the condition precedent was waived by the \ndefendant's actions. The court further noted that the defendant had completed the services \nin concert with the written contract terms. The defendant also paid submitted invoices \n \nfrom the plaintiff, which was another factor establishing acceptance by conduct. The \ncourt found that the condition precedent was not valid because both parties knew it could \nnot be met. \nOther cases are \n2.Brogden v. Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877): Even without formal execution of a \ncontract, the court found a binding agreement due to the parties' ongoing business under \nthe proposed terms. \n3.Empirnall Holdings Pty Ltd v. Machon Paull Partners Pty Ltd (1988): The court \nupheld a contract based on conduct where one party carried out services while the other \nbenefited from them. \n \nCommunication of Acceptance by Conduct \nWhile conduct can serve as acceptance, communication may still play a role. The conduct \nmust occur in a context where the other party understands it as acceptance. If \nperformance begins without notifying the offeror, a dispute could arise over whether a \ncontract was actually formed. \nFor example: \nIn business dealings, sending a confirmation email after performing the first step of a \ncontract may help establish the agreement. \nA party must not act in a way that misleads the offeror into thinking the offer was \nrejected. \nThe law prioritizes mutual understanding, not just isolated actions. \n \nSilence and Inaction in Acceptance by Conduct \n \nIn general, silence or inaction does not constitute acceptance. However, there are limited \ncircumstances where it might: \nPast dealings: If two parties have a history of accepting terms without verbal or written \nconfirmation, silence may be interpreted as assent. \nCustom or usage in trade: In some industries, certain behaviors are accepted as signifying \nagreements. \nUnilateral contracts: If an offer is made for a reward or performance, the offeree may \naccept by completing the act, with no further communication required. \nStill, courts are cautious about finding acceptance in silence, especially when consumer \nprotection or fairness is at stake. \n \nExceptions \n1.In limited circumstances silence can equal acceptance (Rust v Abbey Life Insurance \nCo (1979) (CoA)). Rust had some extra money after selling her hotel and wanted to \ninvest the money in Abbey Life property bonds. She filled in an application for the \ninvestment and wrote a cheque for the investment amount which she then sent to Abbey \nLife. Rust received the investment policy documents which she should have signed and \nreturned. She failed to do so and after several months, unhappy with her investment, she \ntried to argue that as she had never signed and agreed to the policy she could claim her \nmoney back. The court held that Rust’s silence and previous conduct indicated \nacceptance even though she hadn’t returned the signed policy. \nIn Dresdner Kleinwort Limited & Anor v Attrill & Ors (2013) (CoA) a company \nannounced that it was offering its employees bonuses and that they had approved a \n‘guaranteed bonus pool’ to pay these bonuses. Later, they tried to reduce the bonuses to \n90% less than what was originally promised. The court said that there was no need for the \nemployees to have ‘accepted’ the original offer in order for the company to be bound by \nit. The company had the contractual power to give bonuses without needing acceptance \n \nof them under the contracts of employment with its employees. By announcing the \nbonuses, they also implicitly waived the need for acceptance. \n \n2.Exceptions To Certainty Of Acceptance \nHowever, there will be occasions where an otherwise vague or ambiguous phrase may be \ngiven specific meaning by the courts. To give effect to the intentions of the parties, the \ncourt can look to standard commercial practice or the previous dealings of the parties to \ndefine any ambiguous term. The courts should interpret words in an agreement in such a \nway as to preserve, rather than destroy, its subject matter (Hillas v Arcos (1932)). \nHillas had purchased timber from Arcos. The agreement contained an option to purchase \nan extra 100,000 units at a discounted rate with the price to be agreed the following year. \nArcos refused to honour this, arguing that the term was too ambiguous to be enforceable, \nit was simply an agreement to agree on a price. However, the court disagreed, the term (to \nset a discounted rate/ price) was objectively certain enough to be enforceable. The \nambiguity as to price was because the price of wood fluctuated over time, it was not \nenough to destroy the agreement all together. \nAn objective reference to determine the meaning of any phrase is vital. In Baird Textile \nHoldings v Marks & Spencer (2001) (CoA) the meaning of ‘reasonable’ quantity and \nprice could not be determined by the court because they had no objective criteria by \nwhich to judge it. The agreement between the parties had never been formally set down \nand therefore it was not possible to interpret what the parties common intention was \nbased on that term. The phrase was too ambiguous to create a contract. \nB. ACCEPTANCE BY WORDS (ORAL OR WRITTEN) \nOne of the recognized and most common forms of acceptance is acceptance by words, \neither orally or in writing.Acceptance by words involves the use of clear and definite \nlanguage, either spoken or written, to convey agreement to the offer. This mode of \nacceptance is also known as express acceptance because it directly and unmistakably \n \nconveys assent. It contrasts with implied acceptance, where conduct or actions signify \nagreement. \nFor instance, where A offers to sell his motorcycle to B for ₦400,000, and B says, “I \naccept the offer and will pay by Friday,” this is oral acceptance. Similarly, if B sends a \nwritten reply to A’s offer saying, “I agree to buy the motorcycle for ₦400,000,” this is \nwritten acceptance. \nThe importance of clear and unambiguous expression of assent in acceptance by words \ncannot be overemphasized. First, it ensures legal certainty. Contracts are based on mutual \nagreement; therefore, clear acceptance eliminates any doubt about whether both parties \nare indeed bound by the agreement. Ambiguous or vague expressions such as “I might \nconsider it” or “I’m thinking about it” do not amount to valid acceptance because they do \nnot show a firm commitment. \nAlso, a clear expression of assent helps in avoiding disputes. Where the offeree's words \nare direct and unmistakable, it becomes easier to prove that a contract was concluded. \nThis is especially important in legal proceedings where the existence or terms of a \ncontract are in dispute. Courts are more likely to enforce agreements where acceptance is \nclearly and unequivocally communicated. \nFurthermore, clear expression serves as evidence of agreement. If the parties later \ndisagree or one party denies the existence of a contract, written or oral acceptance can be \nused to establish the fact that an agreement was indeed reached. This is particularly true \nin business transactions, where documentation plays a key role in contractual relations. \nThe law has laid down that for acceptance to be valid, it must be communicated in a \nmanner recognized by law. The case of Hyde v. Wrench (1840) demonstrates that \nacceptance must be definite and clear. In that case, the defendant offered to sell a farm for \n£1,000. The plaintiff responded with a counter-offer of £950, which was rejected. The \nplaintiff then tried to accept the original offer of £1,000, but the court held that the \noriginal offer had lapsed due to the counter-offer, and no contract existed. This case \nillustrates the principle that acceptance must be clear, unambiguous, and unconditional. \n \nIt is also important to note that silence does not amount to acceptance. In Felthouse v. \nBindley (1862) 11 CBNS 869, an uncle wrote to his nephew offering to buy a horse and \nsaid, “If I hear no more about it, I shall consider the horse mine.” The court held that \nsilence could not constitute acceptance. There must be a positive act of acceptance \nthrough words or conduct. \nIn conclusion, acceptance by words—whether oral or written—is a direct and recognized \nmethod of contract formation. It is crucial that the words used are clear, definite, and \nunqualified, showing a genuine intention to be bound by the terms of the offer. A clear \nexpression of assent not only finalizes the agreement but also protects both parties by \nproviding legal certainty and reducing the risk of dispute. The courts will uphold such \ncontracts where acceptance is clearly and unequivocally expressed \nC. ACCEPTANCE BY DOCUMENTS \nAcceptance by documents refers to the act of accepting an offer through written or \ndocumented means. This form of acceptance is typically evidenced by documents such \nas: Signed contracts, Letters of acceptance,Invoices or receipts, Purchase orders. \nAcceptance by documents provides a clear and tangible record of the agreement, helping \nto prevent disputes and establish the terms of the contract. \nAcceptance by Documents Passing Between the Parties \nAcceptance by documents passing between the parties is a crucial concept in contract \nlaw, particularly in the context of offer and acceptance. It refers to the situation where one \nparty's acceptance of an offer is evidenced by documents exchanged between the parties, \nsuch as signed agreements, invoices, or other forms of written communication. This form \nof acceptance is significant because it provides tangible proof of the agreement between \nthe parties. \n \nForms of Documented Acceptance \n \n1. Signed Agreements: When both parties sign a contract or agreement that outlines the \nterms of the deal, it serves as strong evidence of acceptance. The act of signing indicates \nthat both parties have read, understood, and agreed to the terms \n2. Invoices Acknowledged: In commercial transactions, an offer might be made through \nan offer to sell goods or services, and acceptance can be evidenced by the buyer \nacknowledging or accepting an invoice for those goods or services. This acknowledgment \ncan be in the form of a signature or a written confirmation. \n3. Emails and Letters: In today's digital age, acceptance can also be communicated \nthrough emails or letters that clearly indicate agreement to the terms of an offer. If an \nofferee responds to an offer with an email or letter that accepts the terms without \nreservation, it constitutes acceptance. \n4. Purchase Orders: In business transactions, a purchase order sent by a buyer to a seller \ncan serve as acceptance of the seller's offer to supply goods or services at specified terms. \nThe case of Currie v. Misa (1875) is a seminal example of acceptance by document. In \nthis case, Mr. Misa purchased bills of exchange from a merchant, Lizardi, and directed \nMisa to make payment to the claimant bank, Glyn, Mills, Currie & Co. Misa made \npayment by cheque, which was accepted by the bank. The court held that the bank's \nacceptance of the cheque constituted valid consideration for the bills of exchange. The \ncourt's decision in Currie v. Misa established that a written document can serve as \nevidence of acceptance, creating a binding contract between parties. \nA written document, such as a contract or agreement, outlines the terms and conditions of \nthe agreement between parties. When a party signs or accepts a written document, they \nindicate their intention to be bound by the terms outlined in the document. \nObligations by written document imply that the written document should clearly outline \nthe terms of the agreement. This includes the parties involved, the subject matter, and the \nterms and conditions of the agreement. Secondly, one party must make an offer, and the \nother party must accept the terms of the offer. Also, there must be valid consideration, \nsuch as a benefit gained or detriment suffered. \n \n \nExceptions to Acceptance by Document \nWhile acceptance by document is a widely accepted principle, there are exceptions to \nconsider: \n1. Fraud or Misrepresentation: If a party is induced to accept a document through fraud or \nmisrepresentation, the contract may be voidable. \n2. Undue Influence: If a party is subject to undue influence or coercion, their acceptance \nof a document may not be considered valid. \n3. Lack of Capacity: If a party lacks the capacity to enter into a contract, their acceptance \nof a document may not be binding. \nIn conclusion, a written document can serve as evidence of acceptance, creating a binding \ncontract between parties. By understanding the principles outlined in this case, parties can \ncreate valid contracts that are enforceable by law. Written documents provide a clear \nrecord of the agreement, reduce the risk of disputes and misunderstandings, and serve as \na basis for enforcing contractual obligations. \nD.ACCEPTANCE BY POST \nAcceptance by post is one of the various forms of acceptance that we have. In contract \nlaw, acceptance by post (also known as the postal rule) is generally valid upon posting the \nacceptance, not upon receipt by the offeror. This means that once the offeree places a \nproperly addressed and stamped letter of acceptance in the mail, the contract is formed, \neven if the offeror never actually receives the letter or receives it after a significant delay. \nThe postal rule is a contract principle that governs situations in which acceptance is not \nmade in person and where the contract or offer does not specify the method and timing of \nacceptance. In summary, the postal rule dictates that acceptance of an offer made by letter \nand sent by post is effective upon postage of the letter. This can cause problems, as this \nposition will be maintained even if the letter is delayed or lost in the post. The postal rule \ngenerally in contract law means that when you accept an offer by post (mail), the \n \nacceptance takes effect as soon as you post the letter, not when the person receives it. In \nsimpler words: If someone offers you a deal, and you send back your \"yes\" in a letter, the \ndeal is officially accepted the moment you drop the letter in the mailbox, even if the other \nperson hasn’t received it yet. \nPrinciples of Postal Rule in Contract Law \nThere are several principles applicable to the postal rule as a model of acceptance in \ncontract law. \n1. Acceptance is effective once the letter is posted. As soon as the acceptance letter is \nproperly posted, a binding contract is formed. It doesn’t matter if the letter is delayed, \nlost, or never arrives. For example, if you drop your acceptance in a mailbox, the contract \nis formed at that moment. The core principle is that the acceptance is binding the moment \nit is placed in the postal system, not when it arrives at the offeree's address. \nThis first principle applies to the case of Adams v. Lindsell (1818). The facts of the case \nwere that Lindsell (the defendant) wrote to Adams (the claimant) offering to sell wool, \nand asked for a reply “in the course of post.” Adams received the letter and posted his \nacceptance the same day. However, due to a postal delay, Lindsell didn’t get the \nacceptance when expected. Thinking Adams wasn’t interested, Lindsell sold the wool to \nsomeone else. Adams sued for breach of contract. The issue was: was there a binding \ncontract when Adams posted the acceptance, even though Lindsell hadn’t received it yet? \nYes. The court held that the contract was formed when Adams posted the acceptance \nletter, not when Lindsell received it. \n2. The postal rule only applies to acceptance—not to offers or revocations. Offers or \ncancellations (revoking an offer) must be received to be valid. Only acceptance gets the \nspecial rule. \nFor instance, if Baola sends an offer and then wants to cancel it, the cancellation must \nreach Xinnuan before Xinnuan posts their acceptance. \nThis can be seen in the decided case of Byrne v. Van Tienhoven (1880). The facts were \nthat Van Tienhoven sent an offer from Cardiff to New York. A week later, he sent a \n \nrevocation, but before it reached Byrne, Byrne had already posted an acceptance. It was \nheld by the court that the revocation was not effective because Byrne had already \naccepted the offer by post. The crux here is that revocations must be received to be valid \n— postal rule doesn’t apply to revoking offers. \n \n3. The acceptance must be correctly addressed and stamped, and it must be properly \nposted, meaning it has been handed over to the postal authorities. \nThis principle could be seen in the case of Re London & Northern Bank, ex parte Jones \n(1900). In the case, a letter of acceptance was handed to a postman who was not \nauthorized to collect mail. The court held that there was no valid posting, so acceptance \nwas not effective. \nLesson: The postal rule only works when the letter is properly posted through the correct \npostal system. \nThe postal rule was first established in the case of Adams v. Lindsell (1818). In this case, \nthe court held that the plaintiff was entitled to damages because the defendant sold the \nwool to someone else before receiving the plaintiff's acceptance. The court ruled that \nacceptance was complete when the letter was posted, and the defendant was bound by the \ncontract. This decision set a precedent for future cases involving acceptance by post. \n \nExceptions to Postal Rule in Contract Law \nIt is to be noted that we also have several exceptions to the postal rule in the law of \ncontract. In simpler words, an exception is something that does not follow the general \nrule. It is a special case where the usual rule does not apply. For example, under the \npostal rule, acceptance is complete once a letter is posted. An exception can be that if the \noffer says “acceptance must be received,” then posting is not enough — it must actually \nbe received. Moving on, we have various exceptions such as: \n \n \n1. When the acceptance is communicated through methods like telephone, telex, or email, \nthe postal rule generally does not apply. \nThis was enforced in the case of Entores Ltd v. Miles Far East Corp (1955). In the \ncase, Entores (UK) sent acceptance by telex to Miles (in the Netherlands). Miles later \nargued there was no contract since they didn’t see it in time. The court ruled that \nacceptance by telex is only valid when received. Unlike postal letters, telex is instant \ncommunication. So, the postal rule does not apply. \n2. When the offeror explicitly states that acceptance is not effective until received, thus \navoiding the postal rule. \nA case that applies to this is Holwell Securities Ltd v. Hughes (1974). \nHughes offered to sell property and required acceptance by “notice in writing.” The \nofferee, Holwell, posted a letter of acceptance, but it was never delivered. They argued \nthe postal rule should apply. The court rejected this, saying the offer required actual \nnotice. Therefore, acceptance had to be received, not just posted. \n3. When the acceptance letter is not properly posted. If the letter is incorrectly addressed, \nnot stamped, or handed to the wrong person, it’s not valid. \nThe case of Re London & Northern Bank, ex parte Jones (1900) applies to this. Jones \ngave an acceptance letter to a postman who was not allowed to collect mail. The letter \nnever entered the official postal system. The court held that acceptance was not valid \nbecause proper posting means using a mailbox or authorized post office worker. If not \ncorrectly posted, the postal rule won’t work. \n4. When a rejection is sent by the offeror before the acceptance of the offeree. If the \nofferee sends a rejection letter that arrives before the acceptance letter, the offer is \nconsidered rejected, even if the acceptance is later received. \nThe case of Hyde v. Wrench (1840) applies to this scenario. Wrench offered to sell his \nfarm to Hyde for £1,000. Hyde replied with a counter-offer of £950, which acted as a \nrejection of the original offer. Wrench rejected the £950. Hyde then tried to accept the \n \noriginal £1,000 offer. The court held that the original offer was no longer valid after the \ncounter-offer. A counter-offer kills the original offer, making it unavailable for later \nacceptance. This re-established the exception that once rejected, an offer cannot be \nrevived by later acceptance unless re-offered. \n5. When it is unreasonable to use the post in a contract. If it's not reasonable to use post \n(e.g., urgent offers, or parties close by), the postal rule won't apply. \nThe case of Henthorn v. Fraser (1892) is applicable to this. Fraser made an offer to \nHenthorn in person. Henthorn lived in a different town and posted an acceptance. Fraser \ntried to revoke the offer before receiving the letter. The court ruled postal rule applied \nbecause distance made posting reasonable. But the case made clear: if posting is \nunreasonable, postal rule won’t apply. \n6. In Holwell Securities v. Hughes (1974), the court held that the postal rule doesn't \napply when the offer's terms require the acceptance to reach the offeror. In this case, the \noffer specified that acceptance had to be \"by notice in writing,\" and the acceptance was \nposted but never reached the defendant. The court ruled that the postal rule didn't apply, \nand there was no contract. \n7. The postal rule is not absolute and can be excluded by the offeror. If the offeror \nspecifies that acceptance must be communicated in a specific way, such as by fax or \ntelephone, the postal rule may not apply. Additionally, if the offeree incorrectly addresses \nthe letter of acceptance or is careless, causing delay or failure to communicate, the postal \nacceptance rule may not apply, as seen in Getreide-Import GmbH v. Contimar SA \nCompania Industrial, Comercial y Maritima (1953). \nCONCLUSION \nWe've considered various forms of acceptance. Whether by words, by actions, through \ndocuments, or even by post, what matters most is that acceptance shows a clear intention \nto be bound. Acceptance may be express, implied, or documentary,but in all cases, it \nmust be unambiguous. And the element of clarity must be there.", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 7.pdf"}

In \nother words, a party that has not furnished consideration in support of a contract \ncannot enforce it. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between \nparties to a contract, which must move from the promisee to the promisor, and \nwhich the law recognizes as sufficient to enforce a promise.This raises a crucial \nquestion: how does the court determine what constitutes ‘a thing of value’? This \nwork will explore the exegesis of how a thing of value is determined by the court, \nand whether the court has jurisdiction to determine if a consideration is \nadequate or inadequate. It is pertinent to define consideration in order to fully \nunderstand this legal principle. \nA widely accepted and comprehensive definition was provided by Lush J in the \ncase of Curri v. Misa, where he stated:  \n \n“A valuable consideration in the eye of the law may consist either in some \nrights, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, \ndetriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other” \n  \nThe consideration does not only consist of profit by one party but also exists \nwhere the other party abandons some legal right in the present or limits his legal \nfreedom of action in the future as an inducement for the promise of the first. \n \n \nSo it is irrelevant whether one party benefits but enough that the party giving it \ndoes thereby undertake some burden or lose something which in contemplation of \nlaw may be of value. \nFrom the above, it is clear that “a thing of value” in law does not necessarily have \nto be monetary, it may take the form of forbearance, detriment, loss or \nresponsibility. What matters is that there is an exchange: something given in return \nfor a promise. \n \nWHAT ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERATION IN CONTRACT? \nThe importance of consideration in a contract cannot be overstated. To enforce a \ncontract, it has to be proved that the party instituting the action suffered a detriment \nor loss, or a benefit was conferred on him in actual sense. \nSome key importance of consideration include \n \n• ENSURES MUTUAL OBLIGATION: consideration ensures that both parties \ngive something for something. It is a principle that is grounded in reciprocity. If \nonly one party gives the consideration, then it is one-sided. The parties have to \nprove that they both suffered a loss or a benefit; this allows them to have a mutual \nobligation to keep to the terms of the contract, a breach of which can be instituted \nin the law court. This principle is reiterated in the case of Combe v. Combe [1951] \n2 KB 215, where a wife was denied the right to sue her ex-husband over an \nunfulfilled promise to pay her an allowance. It was held that she had given no \nconsideration to have a cause of action. \nThe court, per Denning LJ, held that: “the doctrine of consideration is too firmly \nfixed to be overthrown by a side-wind....it still remains a cardinal necessity of the \nformation of a contract\". \n \n \n \n• ACTS AS EVIDENCE OF INTENTION: consideration implies that the parties \nhave a clear intent to be bound by the terms of a contract. A party that gives \nconsideration is assumed to have given their unequivocal consent to be held \nbound/accountable in the event of a breach. \n \n• PREVENTS GRATUITOUS CLAIM: consideration helps the court in \ndistinguishing vague promises and helping them to avoid enforcing them. This \nsaves the \ncourt from getting involved in non-contractual engagements. In the case of White \nv. Bluet[1853]23 L.J. Ex.36, a son’s promise to stop complaining was held to be \nan \ninvalid consideration. The court won’t enforce bare promises or informal \nmisunderstandings, but legally binding agreements. \n \n• IT DISTINGUISHES ENFORCEABLE PROMISES FROM MERE \nSOCIAL OR MORAL OBLIGATIONS:  \nIn contrast, not every promise is enforceable. For a contract to be enforceable it has \nto be supported by consideration. Mora obligations on their own cannot amount to \na valid consideration, this was reinforced in the case of Thomas v. Thomas (1842) \n2 Q.B. 851, where the court held that a woman’s payment of 1 pound per year was \na valid consideration, despite the fact that living in the house was her husband’s \nwish. From this case, it can be inferred that moral obligation alone is not sufficient \nto enforce a promise, it has to be backed by consideration. \nHaving discussed the meaning and importance of consideration, it becomes \nimportant to discuss one of the key principles that governs its role in contract \nformation, which is that the law only requires that a consideration be of value/ \nsufficient and not necessarily adequate. This principle was established in the \n \n \nNigerian Supreme Court in the case of Gaji v. Paye (2003) FWLR (Pt. 163) p.1, \nwhere the court held that: \n“…once the consideration is of some value in the eye of the law, the court has \nno jurisdiction to determine whether it is adequate or inadequate.” \nThis means that the court does not concern itself with the determination of what is \nfair, right, or balanced as a consideration between parties, rather it focuses on \nwhether the thing exchanged is of legal value. The reason for this principle is to \nuphold the principle of freedom of contract, which allows individuals to go through \nthe bargaining process without interference; giving individuals the latitude to \ndetermine the terms of their agreement. Interference by the court will mean the \ncourt is trying to make a contract on behalf of the parties which is not possible, as \nit undermines contractual autonomy. \nIt is important to note that this principle does not apply in cases where the contract \nwas induced by fraud or duress; in such cases, the court can inquire into the \nfairness of the agreement. However, the court will not invalidate a contract on the \nground that someone got the “better” part of it \n \nNATURE OF CONSIDERATION  \n \nThe quote from Gaji v. Paye (2003) FWLR (Pt. 163) p.1 “...once the \nconsideration is of some value in the eye of the law, the court has no jurisdiction to \ndetermine whether it's adequate or inadequate”.  \n \nThis highlights a fundamental principle of contract law: the sufficiency, not the \nadequacy, of consideration is what matters to the court. In contract law, \nconsideration refers to something of value exchanged between the parties to a \ncontract. It is one of the essential elements that make a contract legally binding, \n \n \nsomething of value must be given for a promise in order to make it enforceable as a \ncontract. An important aspect to note is that consideration must: \ni. Be something of value and  \nii. Be sufficient in the eye of the law. \n \nSufficiency and adequacy are related concepts, however they have distinct \nmeanings. Adequacy typically refers to the quality of being sufficient or acceptable \nin terms of quality, quantity, or degree. It implies meeting a standard or \nrequirement, often in a satisfactory or acceptable manner, that is equality in \nfulfilling an obligation. Sufficiency, on the other hand, refers to the state of being \nenough or sufficient to meet a need, requirement, or demand. It emphasizes the \nminimum requirement of quantity or amount just needed to achieve a particular \ngoal. The major difference between the two concepts in law is that sufficiency \nmeans the consideration must be something the law recognizes as having value. \nThis could be money, goods, a service, a promise to do something, or even a \npromise to undertake some burden. Adequacy on the other hand means the fairness \nor equivalence of the value exchanged. Under common law (and Nigerian contract \nlaw), courts do not assess whether what was given in return is equal or fair in \ncommercial or economic value,only that it is legally sufficient. \n \nIn Gaji v. Paye, the Supreme Court of Nigeria reiterated this longstanding contract \nlaw rule. The case involved a dispute over a land transaction where one party tried \nto argue that the consideration given was not adequate for what was received. The \ncourt held that once there is evidence that some consideration, however small or \nseemingly disproportionate, has been exchanged and recognized by law, then the \ncourt’s duty is to enforce the agreement, not to determine whether the \nconsideration was adequate. This is because parties are deemed to be the best \n \n \njudges of their own bargains. Now there is a rationale behind this rule which \nincludes  \ni. Parties should be free to contract on their own terms without court interference in \nthe fairness of the bargain. \nii. Courts cannot evaluate the subjective value that parties place on items or \npromises. What may seem unfair to one party might be perfectly acceptable to \nanother due to personal or business reasons. \niii. If courts were allowed to evaluate adequacy, it would open floodgates for \nlitigation and make enforcement unpredictable. \nUsing an example: A sells his land to B for ₦1,000. It might seem grossly unfair, \nbut as long as there is no fraud, duress, undue influence, or mistake, and A \nvoluntarily agreed, the court will not interfere simply because of the low price. \nAlso if someone promises to give up smoking (a legal right), that can count as \nsufficient consideration, even though no money or property is exchanged. There \nare similar cases in which this principle  applied, this principle is consistent with \nEnglish contract law, from which Nigerian contract law derives. In Thomas v. \nThomas (1842), it was held that \"consideration must be something which is of \nsome value in the eyes of the law, but it need not be adequate.\" Similarly, in \nChappell & Co Ltd v Nestlé Co Ltd (1960), chocolate wrappers were accepted as \nsufficient consideration even though they had no intrinsic value because they \nformed part of the agreed bargain. Conclusively, the principle expressed in Gaji v. \nPaye affirms that courts are not arbiters of the fairness of bargains but guardians of \nlegal processes. Once it is shown that consideration exists and has some legal \nvalue, the court has no jurisdiction to determine its adequacy. This approach \nensures predictability, respects party autonomy, and maintains the integrity of \ncontract law. If a party wants to avoid unfairness, they must negotiate better terms \n \n \nor prove a legal vitiating factor. The law, in its wisdom, says: a peppercorn is \nenough, if that’s what the parties agreed. \n \n \n \nJUDICIAL ROLE:WHY COURTS DON'T ASSESS ADEQUACY  \nThe principle of freedom of contract is a bedrock of contract law, granting parties \nthe autonomy to freely negotiate and determine their agreement’s terms, including \nthe consideration, without external interference, provided the contract is lawful and \nfree from vitiating factors such as fraud, duress, or undue influence. Consideration, \ndefined as something of value exchanged between parties, must be \nsufficient—meaning it has some legal value—but not necessarily adequate in \neconomic terms. Courts refrain from assessing adequacy to preserve this \ncontractual freedom, recognizing that parties are best positioned to evaluate their \nown interests and determine what constitutes a fair bargain. For instance, nominal \nconsideration like N1 or a peppercorn can sustain a contract if agreed upon, as it \nreflects the parties’ mutual intent. Interfering with the fairness of consideration \nwould introduce uncertainty, discourage commercial transactions, and undermine \nthe predictability essential to contract law, particularly in Nigeria’s growing market \neconomy. \nThe role of courts in contract disputes is confined to ensuring that a valid contract \nexists, requiring elements such as offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to \ncreate legal relations. Courts verify that consideration is lawful and sufficient, but \nthey do not evaluate whether it represents a fair exchange, as this would involve \nsubjective judgments about value that vary across parties and contexts. For \nexample, courts will not question whether a party received adequate value for their \npromise, as this is a matter for the contracting parties to decide. However, courts \n \n \nmay intervene in exceptional cases of procedural unfairness, such as \nunconscionable bargains, coercion, or misrepresentation, where the voluntary \nnature of the agreement is compromised. In Nigeria, this balance is evident in cases \nwhere courts uphold good faith in contract execution but avoid re-evaluating the \nbargain’s fairness. This limited judicial role promotes contractual certainty, \nrespects party autonomy, and safeguards against exploitative practices without \noverstepping into the parties’ negotiated terms. \nNigerian case law strongly reinforces this non-interventionist approach. In \nFaloughi v. Faloughi (1995), a case involving a matrimonial property dispute, the \nCourt of Appeal held that the consideration agreed upon by the parties was their \nprerogative, and courts would not scrutinize its adequacy as long as it was lawful \nand constituted something of value. The court emphasized that interfering with the \nparties’ bargain would undermine the sanctity of their agreement, absent vitiating \nfactors like fraud. Similarly, in Gaji v. Paye (2003), a dispute over a land \ntransaction, the Nigerian Supreme Court ruled that courts are not concerned with \nthe fairness or adequacy of consideration but with its existence and legality. The \ncourt noted that the plaintiff’s payment, though arguably disproportionate, was \nsufficient to bind the contract, reinforcing Nigeria’s alignment with the common \nlaw tradition of prioritizing party autonomy over judicial reassessment of \ncontractual terms. \nForeign cases further illustrate this principle, providing a comparative perspective. \nIn Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestlé Co Ltd [1960] AC 87, the English House of \nLords held that chocolate wrappers, though of minimal economic value, constituted \nvalid consideration because they were part of the agreed promotional scheme, \nemphasizing that sufficiency, not adequacy, is the legal standard. Similarly, in \nThomas v. Thomas (1842) 2 QB 851, a widow’s promise to pay £1 per year as \nrent for a house was upheld as sufficient consideration, with the court explicitly \n \n \nrefusing to assess its fairness. Exceptions exist, such as in Lloyds Bank Ltd v. \nBundy [1975] QB 326, where an unconscionable bargain was set aside due to \nundue influence. In Nigeria, courts similarly address unconscionability, as seen in \nOkeke v. Okeke (2000), where a contract was scrutinized for exploitative terms \ndue to one party’s vulnerability. Cases like Best (Nig.) Ltd v. Blackwood Hodge \n(Nig.) Ltd (2011) further highlight the importance of good faith in Nigeria, but \ncourts consistently avoid reassessing consideration’s adequacy. By limiting their \nrole, courts ensure contractual certainty while intervening only when public policy \nor procedural fairness demands, balancing freedom of contract with protections \nagainst exploitation. \n \nEXCEPTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF CONSIDERATION  \n  \nThe doctrine of consideration is central to the formation of enforceable contracts. It \nimplies that a promise must be supported by something of value (i.e., \nconsideration) for it to be legally binding. While the general principle is that courts \nwill not assess the adequacy of consideration once some value is established, this \nrule is not absolute. As courts generally adopt the doctrine of consideration, as \nestablished in Gaji v Paye (2003) FWLR pt. 163 p.1, there are circumstances \nunder which judicial interference becomes necessary to ensure justice. These \nexceptions often arise where the apparent freedom to contract is tainted by \nirregularities that undermine consent or fairness. \n \nOne major exception is fraud. Courts will interfere where consideration is obtained \nthrough fraudulent misrepresentation. Even though some value might have been \nexchanged, if the contract was formed under false pretences, the consideration is \n \n \ntainted, and the court can nullify the agreement. Fraud renders the contract \nvoidable at the instance of the defrauded party. \nAlso, contracts formed under duress (threats or coercion) or undue influence (abuse \nof power in a relationship) may appear to contain valid consideration, but such \nagreements are not genuine expressions of free will. Courts will step in to protect \nparties from exploitation and set aside such contracts. \nWhere a party enters into a contract based on a misrepresentation of material facts, \neven if consideration is present, the court may set aside the contract. This protects \nthe innocent party and upholds the principle of fairness. \nAs a rule, past consideration is not valid. An act done before a promise is made \ncannot be considered for that promise. However, exceptions exist, especially where \nthe act was done at the promisor’s request with an expectation of future payment \n(Lampleigh v Braithwait). \nAnother exception involves capacity to contract. Minors, persons of unsound mind, \nor parties under statutory incapacity cannot be bound by a contract in the same way \nas competent adults. This is another area where the court may look beyond the face \nof the contract and intervene, even if consideration appears legally sufficient on the \nsurface. \n \nLegal scholars have also provided critical insights into the doctrine of \nconsideration. According to G.H. Treitel, consideration serves to differentiate \nenforceable promises from unenforceable ones. He observed that while the \nprinciple of not evaluating adequacy promotes freedom of contract, it must be \nbalanced against the need to protect parties from exploitation, especially in cases \ninvolving power imbalances or vulnerable individuals. However, he criticizes the \nrigidity of the doctrine, suggesting that it can sometimes hinder justice, particularly \nwhere parties clearly intended to be bound. \n \n \nJ.C. Smith views consideration as a formal requirement that has, in some cases, \noutlived its usefulness. He argues that in the presence of intention to create legal \nrelations and mutual assent, the insistence on consideration might be unnecessary \nand even artificial.  He also argues that strict adherence to the sufficiency rule can \nsometimes produce unjust outcomes, particularly where a grossly inadequate \nconsideration is part of a broader exploitative arrangement.  \nThese scholars support a reformative approach, advocating that the doctrine should \nevolve to reflect modern commercial realities and focus more on the presence of \nmutual obligations than strict legal formalities. \n \nFrom a practical standpoint, the doctrine ensures that contracts are not mere \ngratuitous promises but are supported by real obligations. However, by allowing \ncourts to interfere in cases of inequality, deceit, or coercion, the law seeks to \nbalance contractual freedom with social justice. \nFrom a policy perspective, enforcing contracts with no adequate checks could \npromote exploitation, especially in unequal bargaining relationships. On the other \nhand, too much interference could undermine certainty and freedom to contract, \nkey principles of classical contract law. In Commercial Bank (Credit Lyonnais) \nv. Burch, although not Nigerian, the English Court of Appeal acknowledged the \nrole of undue influence in invalidating otherwise formally correct agreements. \nThus, exceptions to the doctrine act as a safeguard, ensuring that while parties have \nthe liberty to contract, that liberty is not abused. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nIn conclusion, the Nigerian law of contract, as emphasized by Sagay, upholds that \nconsideration must be sufficient but not necessarily adequate. Courts focus on the \nexistence of something of legal value, not its fairness, to protect contractual \n \n \nfreedom and certainty. However, exceptions exist where the contract is tainted by \nfraud, duress, undue influence, or misrepresentation. This balanced approach \nprevents judicial interference in private bargains while safeguarding justice and \nfairness where necessary. Thus, the law respects parties' autonomy while ensuring \nno party exploits the other under the guise of freedom of contract, maintaining both \nlegal consistency and social justice in contractual dealings. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n LIST OF CASES \n1.

{"text": "ABSTRACT  \nThe concept of a cross-offer, a complex  aspect of contract law, arises when two parties \nsimultaneously make identical or substantially similar offers to each other, ordinarily without \nknowledge of the other’s offer. This issue  challenges the traditional principles of offer and \nacceptance, which require a clear offer followed by an unequivocal acceptance to form a \nbinding contract. Cross-offers raise critical questions about mutual assent and the formation \nof a contract, as neither party’s offer can be deemed an acceptance of the other. This paper \ncomprehensively explores the concept of cross-offers through the lens of decided cases, \nanalyzing their legal implications, judicial interpretations, and practical significance in \ncontract law. By examining landmark cases such as Tinn v. Hoffman (1873), Bhagwandas \nGoverdhandas Kedia v. Girdharilal Parshottamdas and Co. (1966) AIR 1966 SC 543, and \nother relevant authorities, the discussion explains  how courts determine whether cross-offers \ncan result in a binding agreement.  \n \nFurthermore, this paper differentiates between cross-offers from counter-offers, while a \ncounter-offer constitutes a rejection and a new offer, a cross-offer occurs in the absence of \ncommunication or knowledge of the other's intention. The discussion outlines the legal \nconsequences of each and explores how they affect enforceability and the timeline of \ncontractual negotiations. By exploring judicial reasoning, doctrinal critiques, and practical \napplications, this paper aims to clarify the legal position of cross-offers and their limited role \nin creating binding contractual obligations. It also considers implications for modern contract \nformation, especially in the context of electronic communications and automated \nnegotiations, where simultaneous or non-sequential exchanges are increasingly common.  \n \n1.0. INTRODUCTION  \nContracts play a veritably important part in our everyday life. A contract is defined as an \nagreement which the law will enforce or recognize as affecting the legal rights and duties of \nthe parties or as an agreement, enforceable by the law between two or more persons to do or \nabstain from doing some act or act.  To constitute a binding contract between parties, there \nmust be a meeting of minds often referred to as consensus ad idem.  In the  case of B.F.I. \nGROUP v. BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (2008) All FWLR (Pt. 407) 1087 at \n1110, the Court of Appeal (Abuja Division) provided a comprehensive definition of a \ncontract. The court stated;  \n \n \n \n“A contract is an agreement between two or more parties which creates reciprocal legal \nobligation or obligations to do or not to do a particular thing. For a valid contract to be \nformed, there must be mutuality of purpose and intention. The two or more minds must \nmeet at the same point, event or incidents. They must be saying the same thing at the same \ntime. They must not be saying different things at different times. Where or when they say a \ndifferent thing at different times, they are not id idem and therefore no valid contract is \nformed. The meeting of minds of the contracting parties is the most crucial and overriding \nfactor or determinant in the law of contract. An agreement will not be binding on the \nparties to it until their minds are at one both upon matters which are cardinal to the species \nof agreement in question and also upon matters that are part of the particular bargain” \n \nThe elements of a valid contract are offer, acceptance, consideration and the intention to enter \ninto legal relations. An Offer may be defined as a definite undertaking or promise, made by \none party with the intention that it shall become binding on the party making it, as soon as it \nis accepted by the party to whom it is addressed. According to the case of Sunday Akanmu v. \nOluwole Olugbode, the Court of Appeal, defined an offer from another angle thus: \n \n           “An offer is an expression to contract on certain terms by a person by whom  \n             it is made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is  \n             accepted by the party to whom it is addressed . Once the offer is unconditionally \n             accepted, a valid binding contract has come into existence “. \n \nAn Acceptance has been defined by Tobi, J.C.A. in the case of Oriente Bank (Nig.) plc. v. \nBilante International Ltd.  as “the reciprocal act or action of the offeree to the offer in which \nhe indicates his agreement to the terms of the offer as conveyed to him by the offeror. \nConsideration is something of value exchanged between the parties to a contract. \nConsideration can be many things such as money, property, service, work performance, or a \npromise to not do something. As long as the parties to the contract exchange something of \nvalue between each other, there is consideration. Classic definition comes from Sir Frederick \nPollock, adopted in the case of Currie v. Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, where the court said: \n“Consideration is some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party, or some \nforbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.” \nThe last element is the Intention to enter into legal relations. The intention to create legal \n \n \nrelations means both parties to an agreement must have intended for their agreement to be \nlegally binding, with the understanding that it could be enforced by law.  \n \n2.0. CROSS-OFFER AS AN INVALID FORM OF ACCEPTANCE  \nAn Acceptance has been established to mean a final and unqualified expression of assent to \nthe terms of the offer. In the case of Felthouse v. Bindley(1862) and Major-General George \nInnih (RTD) & Ors v. Ferado Agro and Consortium Ltd, a valid acceptance is defined as  \none that is expressly communicated as an assent to the terms of the offer, as proposed by the \nofferor. An acceptance is ineffective unless there is a complete agreement on all material \ncontract terms. There are several situations in which there is apparent acceptance of an offer, \nbut which in fact turns out for different reasons to be invalid and ineffective. It will be a \nnecessity for us to briefly discuss some other forms of an Invalid Acceptance before we \ndiscuss in detail our major concern in this work, which is the  Cross-offer. \n●​ Counter-offer: For acceptance to be valid, there must be unequivocal assent to the \nterms of an offer. Where an alteration has been made to the terms of an offer by the \nofferee, acceptance of such is referred to as a counter-offer. Due to moderation of the \nterms of the offer, an entirely new offer has been created which is distinct and \nseparate from the original offer. The counter-offer is well illustrated by the case of \nDalek Nig. v. OMPADEC, where the court of appeal held that, “ it is a counter-offer \nwhich is not only an acceptance of the offer but amounts to a rejection of the original \noffer, with the result that if the original offer is subsequently accepted, its acceptance \ndoes not result in a contract between the parties”  \n●​ Conditional acceptance or acceptance “subject to contract” and a “ provisional” \nacceptance: Conditional acceptance is not a valid or binding acceptance. Any \nacceptance that is made subject to a condition cannot create a binding contract until \nsuch condition has been met or fulfilled. An example of such acceptance is “subject to \ncontract” which is not valid until a contract is formed. In the case of Winn v. Bull, the \ndefendant agreed to take a lease of a house “subject to the preparation and approval of \na formal contract”. The Court held that, in the absence of a formal contract, the \nagreement was not binding. A provisional agreement has the opposite effect of an \nagreement made subject to contract in that it is binding on the parties to it. This led to \nthe judgement in Att. Gen. of Federation V. Awojoodu where the contract was held to \nbe binding because of the use of the term “provisional”. For the purpose of justice, \nprovisional acceptance can only be decided based on the context of its use. \n \n \n●​ Acceptance in ignorance of offer: It is a settled position of the law that a person \ncannot accept an offer that he/she is unaware of.  This invalid form of acceptance is \ncommon with unilateral contracts such as reward cases where someone does \nsomething unaware of the reward and then tries to claim the reward later on. There are \ncontradictory judgments on this because in Gibbons V. Proctor, it was held that it is \npossible to accept an offer in ignorance of it. However in Fitch V. Snedaker,  it was \nheld that a reward cannot be claimed by one who did not know that it had been \noffered. Also in R. V. Clarke it was held that a person cannot accept a reward offer if \nthe reward was not the motive of their actions. However, the decision in Williams V. \nCowardine shows that knowledge of the offer renders the motive of the action \nirrelevant.  \n \n●​ Cross-offer \nA cross offer occurs when two parties make identical offers to each other in ignorance of the \nother’s offer. The offers made by the two parties are usually identical in terms, such as price, \nquantity, obligations and conditions and are usually made in total unawareness of each other's \naction for a cross offer to occur. The two parties send each other this offer by post or other \nmeans and the offer ‘cross’ in the post or en route. Cross offer therefore means a situation in \ncontract law that occurs when two parties make offers that are identical in terms and send \nthem to each other in ignorance of the other's offer.  \nCross-offers are invalid forms of acceptance because: \n         - No party is aware of the other’s offer at the time of making theirs \n         -There is no communication of acceptance \n       -  The sequence required for mutual assent is missing \nImagine \n- Student A in UI offers to sell a hair product for ₦2000 via WhatsApp. \n- Student B, unaware of this, also sends a message offering to buy the same product for \n₦2000. \n- Due to network delay, both offer cross paths. \n-Legal Outcome: No contract is formed. Though the offers match, neither party accepted the \nother's offer; they were merely proposals sent independently. \nAnother instance is that, supposing A who  has been negotiating with B to buy B’s land for \nsome time, writes to B, offering to buy the land for #200,000, and B, independently and in  \nignorance of A’s intentions writes to B offering to his land to B for #200,000, both letters \n \n \ncross in the post. The question here now is that, is there a contract for the sale of B's land to A \nfor #200,000? The answer is “NO”. All we have are just two identical offers, and no \nacceptance. For a contract to emerge, there must be an offer by one party to the other, and the \nother consenting to the offers , indicates his acceptance of it. The critical issue is whether \ncross-offers, which demonstrate a mutual intention to contract on similar terms, can result in \na binding agreement. The resolution of this question hinges on the principles of mutual assent \nand the \"meeting of minds\" (consensus ad idem), a cornerstone of contract law. We shall \nexplore a landmark case that has evolved over time on the concept of cross-offer. \n \n3.0. LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND CASE EVALUATION ON CROSS-OFFER  \nThe formation of a contract under common law requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, \nand an intention to create legal relations. In the case of cross-offers, the simultaneous nature \nof the offers means that neither party has had the opportunity to accept the other’s offer at the \ntime the offers are made. This raises the question of whether the mutual expression of intent \nthrough identical offers can substitute for the traditional offer-acceptance sequence. Courts \nhave consistently held that cross-offers do not automatically result in a binding contract \nunless there is a subsequent act of acceptance or conduct that demonstrates agreement. This \nprinciple ensures that the parties’ intentions are aligned and that a contract is not imposed \nwithout clear mutual assent. A prominent case that explains cross-offer is the case of Tinn v. \nHoffman & Co. (1873).  \nFacts \nIn that case, the defendant, Mr Hoffman wrote to the plaintiff, Mr Tinn, on November 28, \n1871 with an offer to sell him 800 tons of iron for the price of 69s per ton. He requested a \nreply to this offer by post. On the same day, without knowing of this offer, Mr Tin also wrote \nto Mr Hoffman offering to buy 800 tons of iron at 69s per tons. The plaintiff contended that \nthere was a contract for 800 tons at 69s per ton.  \nIssues \nThe issue in this case was whether there was a valid contract between Mr Tinn and Mr \nHoffman for the sale of the iron. There was also the issue of if acceptance had to be by post \nfor it to be valid, as this was specified in the offer. \nDecision and Outcome \nIt was held in this case that there was no contract between Mr Tinn and Mr Hoffman for the \niron. The cross offers were made simultaneously and without knowledge of one another; this \nwas not a contract that would bind the parties for the iron. There is a difference between a \n \n \ncross offer and a counter offer. In order to form a valid contract, there must be \ncommunication that consists of an offer and acceptance. There was no acceptance by post, as \nhad been stated in the offer. The court also said that while post had been indicated in the \noffer, another equally fast method would have been successful, such as a telegram or verbal \nmessage. \n \nFrom the above case, we can see that there was no contract. What existed was merely two \nsimultaneous offers. The  court’s position was aligned with the essentials of a valid contract, \nand that being, that an offer must be unambiguous and certain in nature and that every valid \ncontract requires a properly communicated agreement or assent that is known to all parties \ninvolved in the specific contract. To this effect, the court invalidated the contract.  \nThe concept of cross offers was further explained in the case of Bhagwandas Goverdhandas \nKedia v. Girdharilal Parshottamdas and Co. (1966) AIR 1966 SC 543. In this case, the \nplaintiff and the defendant exchanged several letters negotiating the sale of certain goods. \nThe plaintiff offered to sell the goods to the defendant, and the defendant made a counteroffer \nto buy the same goods at a lower price. The plaintiff did not accept the defendant’s offer, and \nthe defendant did not accept the plaintiff’s offer. The court held that there was no contract as \nboth parties had made cross offers, and neither offer was accepted. Likewise, In the Indian \ncase of Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913), the court held that a cross-offer does not result \nin a valid contract because neither party has accepted the other’s offer.  \n \n4.0. CROSS-OFFER AND COUNTER-OFFER  \nCross-offer and Counter-offer are both types of an Invalid form of acceptance. While a \ncross-offer refers to a situation where two parties simultaneously make identical offers to \neach other, a counter-offer is a response made by one party to an initial offer by the other \nparty that changes the terms of the original offer. A cross-offer occurs when two parties make \nidentical offers to each other, without either party knowing about the other’s offer as seen in \nthe case of Tinn v. Hoffman. In such a situation, there is no acceptance because both parties \nare making offers at the same time, and neither party has had the opportunity to accept or \nreject the other’s offer. This is because acceptance requires an unequivocal expression of \nagreement to the terms of the offer. In a cross-offer situation, there is no such clear agreement \nbecause both parties are simultaneously making identical offers to each other. \nOn the other hand, a counter-offer is a response made by one party to an initial offer made by \nthe other party that changes the terms of the original offer. In other words, it is a rejection of \n \n \nthe initial offer and a simultaneous making of a new offer as revealed in the case of Hyde v \nWrench (1840). The difference between a cross-offer and a counter-offer lies in the fact that \nin a cross-offer, there is no acceptance. In contrast, in a counter-offer, there is a rejection of \nthe initial offer and a simultaneous making of a new offer.  \n \n5.0. MODERN APPLICATION AND CHALLENGES OF CROSS-OFFER  \nThe idea of a cross-offer, where two parties simultaneously make identical or substantially \nsimilar offers to each other without knowledge of the other’s offer, remains relevant in \nmodern commercial and digital contexts. As communication technologies and global trade \nevolve, cross-offers present both new applications and unique challenges. These applications \nand their setbacks will be explored subsequently. \n \n5.0.0.Modern Applications of Cross-offer \nOne of the modern applications of cross-offer is the e-commerce platforms and online market \nplaces. Cross-offers can occur when buyers and sellers simultaneously submit identical bids \nor offers. For instance, a buyer may place an offer to purchase an item at a specific price at \nthe same moment the seller confirms availability or proposes the same price.  \nCross-Border Transactions and Global trade is another modern application of cross-offer. In \ninternational commerce, cross-offers can occur due to simultaneous communications across \ntime zones, especially in industries like commodities trading or shipping. For instance, two \ncompanies in different countries might email identical offers to buy or sell goods at the same \nprice, unaware of the other’s proposal due to delays in communication or time zone \ndifferences. \nModern application of the concept cross-offer can also feature in Instant messaging and \nreal-time negotiations. With the rise of instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, or \nemail,  cross-offers can occur in real-time negotiations where parties send offers at the same \ntime. This is common in business-to-business (B2B) deals or freelance negotiations. For \ninstance, two freelancers might at the same time,  propose the same fee for a project via \nemail, unaware of the other’s offer. Clear follow-up communication is needed to confirm \nagreement. \n \n5.0.1 Challenges of Cross-offer in Modern Context \nThe modern application of cross-offer poses some challenges. One of these challenges is \nAmbiguity in Contract Formation. The core challenge of cross-offers, as established in \n \n \nTinn v. Hoffman (1873) 29 LT 271, is that they do not automatically form a contract because \nneither offer constitutes an acceptance. In modern contexts, this can create ambiguity, \nespecially in fast-paced digital transactions where parties expect immediate results. To \naddress this, Platforms must implement clear rules for offer matching and acceptance, such as \nautomated confirmation emails or system-generated contract agreements. \nAnother challenge is Consumer Expectations and Trust. In consumer transactions, \ncross-offers can create confusion if platforms fail to clarify contract formation. Consumers \nmay assume a contract exists based on identical offers, leading to disputes if the seller does \nnot proceed. This can erode trust in online marketing platforms, as consumers may feel \nmisled if transactions fail due to cross-offer issues. This can be mitigated through Platforms’ \nprovision of clear, user-friendly notifications of order confirmation and acceptance to align \nwith consumer expectations. Time Zone and Communication Delays is another issue. In \nglobal transactions, time zone differences and communication delays can exacerbate \ncross-offer issues. For instance, emails sent simultaneously from different continents may not \nbe received at the same time, complicating the determination of offer and acceptance. This \ncan lead to disputes over whether an offer was accepted or if a contract exists, particularly in \nindustries like shipping or commodities trading where timing is critical. To overcome this, \nParties should use real-time communication platforms or centralized trade systems that log \noffers with precise timestamps to avoid confusion. \n \n6.0. CONCLUSION  \nClear communication is essential in contract law, as it ensures that all parties understand and \nagree to the terms of a legally binding agreement. Without it, the risk of disputes, \nmisunderstandings, and unenforceable contracts increases significantly. The concept of \ncross-offers foregrounds the complexities of contract formation when traditional \noffer-acceptance principles are disrupted. Cross-offers, though seemingly mutual, do not \nconstitute a legally binding agreement. Their failure lies in the absence of an express and \ncommunicated acceptance, which is a non-negotiable requirement for contract formation. \nBoth Nigerian and English jurisprudence emphasize that without consensus ad idem, there \ncan be no contract. Therefore, cross-offers serve as academic examples of what a contract is \nnot, despite appearing on the surface to show agreement. The decision in Tinn v. Hoffman \nremains the cornerstone of judicial reasoning, emphasizing that cross-offers do not inherently \ncreate a binding contract without a subsequent act of acceptance. As communication \ntechnologies evolve, the principles governing cross-offers will continue to be tested, \n \n \nrequiring courts to balance formal legal requirements with practical considerations of intent \nand conduct.", "filename": "fam\\GROUP 9.pdf"}
