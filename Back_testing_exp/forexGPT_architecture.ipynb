    "# **ForexGPT — System Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview of Layers**\n",
    "The system is organized into 5 clean layers, each independent enough to be built in parallel but connected through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Layer 1 — Data Layer**\n",
    "This is where all raw data lives and gets processed before anything else touches it.\n",
    "Data Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seeking Alpha\n",
    "- Manual collection — From the official website\n",
    "\n",
    "What gets stored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw earnings transcripts (text)\n",
    "- Preprocessed & chunked transcript segments\n",
    "- Labeled training examples (transcript excerpt → signal JSON)\n",
    "- Historical forex price data (for signal validation)\n",
    "- User data & session info\n",
    "- Generated signals & backtesting results\n",
    "\n",
    "Database: Supabase\n",
    "PostgreSQL + built-in auth + auto-generated REST API + real-time subscriptions + generous free tier. Saves significant backend time in a 3-week window.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Layer 2 — ML / AI Layer**\n",
    "One fine-tuning run. One base model. Two different interaction modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model: Mistral 7B (via Hugging Face)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 1 — Signal Extraction (Fine-Tuned)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the ONLY module that gets fine-tuned\n",
    "\n",
    "Why: It needs to learn a very specific pattern — reading earnings transcript text and outputting structured signal JSON. Mistral has no knowledge of this out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data: 150-200 labeled earnings transcript pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: LoRA (Rank 8, Alpha 16, LR 2e-4, Batch 4, 3 Epochs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"currency_pair\": \"EUR/USD\",\n",
    "  \"direction\": \"SHORT\",\n",
    "  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n",

    "  \"time_horizon\": \"next_quarter\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Hosted as a Hugging Face Inference Endpoint (private)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 — Educational Mentor (Prompt-Engineered)**\n",
    "- Uses the BASE Mistral 7B — no fine-tuning needed\n",
    "- Driven by a carefully crafted system prompt + few-shot examples\n",
    "- Handles: step-by-step concept explanations, decision guidance, reasoning chains, trading scenario Q&A\n",
    "- Why prompt engineering is enough: Mistral is already a strong reasoning model. The mentor behavior is about *how* it responds, not *what domain knowledge* it needs to learn — that's a prompting problem, not a training problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 3 — Code Generation (Prompt-Engineered)**\n",
    "- Also uses the BASE Mistral 7B — no fine-tuning needed\n",
    "- Driven by a system prompt that sets production-grade Python code standards\n",
    "- Input: strategy description in plain English\n",
    "- Output: working Python code with error handling, logging, and documentation\n",
    "- Why prompt engineering is enough: Code generation is a well-established Mistral strength. A good prompt with a few examples of strategy → code pairs is sufficient\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Backtesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Simulating a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance before risking real money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Backtesting** - Ignores all trading costs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Entry: 1.0900\n",
    "   Exit: 1.1000\n",
    "   Profit = 100 pips (what student thinks)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Realistic Backtesting** - Includes all real costs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Entry: 1.0900 (but pays 1.09002 due to spread)\n",
    "   Exit: 1.1000 (but gets 1.09998 due to spread)\n",
    "   Costs: 6.5 pips (spread, slippage, commission, financing)\n",
    "   Actual Profit = 100 - 6.5 = 93.5 pips (reality)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 4 Trading Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **BID-ASK SPREAD** (2-4 pips)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** The difference between the price you can BUY at (ask) and SELL at (bid).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it exists:** Brokers profit from this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Market shows: EUR/USD = 1.0950 (mid-price, what you see)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reality:\n",
    "  Bid price (if you sell):  1.09500\n",
    "  Ask price (if you buy):   1.09502\n",
    "  Spread: 0.00002 = 2 pips\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter:  You pay 1.09502 (ask) not 1.0950 → LOSE 2 pips\n",
    "When you exit:   You get 1.09500 (bid) not 1.0950 → LOSE 2 pips\n",
    "Total spread cost: 4 pips per round trip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Representation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CostModel:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.entry_spread = 2.0  # pips (normal conditions)\n",
    "        self.exit_spread = 2.0   # pips\n",

    "        \"\"\"Total spread cost for entry + exit\"\"\"\n",
    "        return self.entry_spread + self.exit_spread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread Adjustment by Market Condition:**\n",
    "- Normal conditions: 2 pips\n",
    "- Volatile conditions: 4 pips\n",
    "- Extreme volatility: 8 pips\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **SLIPPAGE** (1-3 pips)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** The difference between your intended execution price and the actual price you got.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it happens:** Time delay between clicking \"BUY\" and order reaching the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Timeline of a trade:\n",
    "1. You see: EUR/USD = 1.0950 on your screen\n",
    "2. You click: BUY\n",
    "3. Order travels to broker: 50 milliseconds\n",
    "4. Broker sends to liquidity provider: 100 milliseconds\n",
    "5. Order reaches market: 200 milliseconds total\n",
    "6. Price has moved to: 1.09501 (while your order was traveling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "  You wanted to buy at: 1.0950\n",
    "  You actually bought at: 1.09501\n",
    "  Slippage: 1 pip (you got worse price)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Realistic Slippage Scenarios:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scenario 1: Fast broker, normal market\n",
    "  Intended: 1.0950\n",
    "  Actual: 1.0950 (no slippage)\n",
    "  Loss: 0 pips\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Average broker, normal market\n",
    "  Intended: 1.0950\n",
    "  Actual: 1.09501\n",
    "  Loss: 1 pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 3: Slow broker, volatile market\n",
    "  Intended: 1.0950\n",
    "  Actual: 1.09505\n",
    "  Loss: 5 pips (execution delayed too long)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Code Representation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CostModel:\n",

    "#### 3. **COMMISSION** (0.5-1 pip equivalent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Broker's fee for executing your trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it exists:** Broker's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Broker charges: $5 per trade\n",
    "You trade: 1 lot = 100,000 units of currency\n",
    "\n",

    "- At EUR/USD = 1.0950\n",
    "- 100,000 EUR × 1.0950 = $109,500 total value\n",
    "- Commission: $5 / $109,500 = 0.0000456 = 0.456 pips\n",
    "\n",
    "So $5 commission ≈ 0.5 pips (in trading terms)\n",
    "\n",
    "Per round trip (entry + exit):\n",
    "- Entry commission: 0.25 pips\n",
    "- Exit commission: 0.25 pips\n",
    "- Total: 0.5 pips\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Broker Models:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Market Maker Broker:\n",
    "- No commission charge\n",
    "- Wide spreads: 3-4 pips\n",
    "- Total cost: 6-8 pips per round trip\n",
    "\n",
    "ECN Broker:\n",
    "- Commission: $5-10 per trade = 0.5-1 pip\n",
    "- Tight spreads: 0.5-1 pip\n",
    "- Total cost: 1.5-2 pips per round trip (BETTER)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Representation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_commission_pips(self, entry_price, position_size_lots=1):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert USD commission to pips\"\"\"\n",
    "    units = position_size_lots * 100000\n",
    "    total_value = units * entry_price\n",
    "    commission_as_percentage = self.commission_usd / total_value\n",

    "    return commission_pips\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **FINANCING COST** (0.01-0.1 pips per day)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Interest paid (or earned) for holding a position overnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it exists:** Currency interest rate differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",

    "- EUR rate: 4% per year\n",
    "- USD rate: 5% per year\n",
    "- You're LONG EUR (bought EUR, sold USD)\n",
    "- So you EARN EUR interest, PAY USD interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Net cost:\n",
    "- You PAY: 5% USD interest per year\n",
    "- You EARN: 4% EUR interest per year\n",
    "- Net: PAY 1% per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Per day: 1% / 365 = 0.00274% per day\n",
    "On $109,500 (your position value): \n",
    "  Cost = $109,500 × 0.0000274 = $3 per day\n",
    "In pips: $3 / $10 per pip = 0.3 pips per day\n",

    "### COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Why do we need to account for all these costs?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \"Because real trading has these costs. If we don't account for them,\n",
    "students build strategies that look good on paper but fail in real trading.\n",
    "We want to build real competence, not false confidence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Aren't these costs different for each broker?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \"Yes. Our framework uses realistic TYPICAL costs. When students use a real\n",
    "broker, they'll know what costs to expect. We provide a model to think about\n",
    "costs, not exact numbers for one broker.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"How do we know our cost estimates are right?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \"We based them on data from major forex brokers:\n",
    "- Typical spreads: 2-4 pips\n",
    "- Typical slippage: 1-2 pips\n",
    "- Typical commission: $5 per trade\n",
    "- Financing: varies by currency pair\n",
    "These are industry standard.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"What if a student disagrees with the cost model?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \"Great! They can adjust the costs in our model to match their broker.\n",
    "We provide a template they can customize. This teaches them to think\n",
    "about costs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: \"Doesn't this make strategies look worse than they are?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \"No. This shows students the REAL profitability. A strategy with\n",
    "100 pips gross profit and 6.55 pips in costs makes 93.45 pips net.\n",
    "That's the truth. And it's still profitable! This teaches students to\n",
    "focus on strategies that are profitable AFTER costs.\""
